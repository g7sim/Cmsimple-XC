Tutorial
========

This chapter introduces several ideas and concepts of Plib_XH
which can be useful to develop CMSimple_XH plugins.
The tutorial requires some basic knowledge of PHP and Web development
in general, and also some working knowledge of developing CMSimple_XH plugins.
If you have never developed a CMSimple_XH plugin before,
consider to walk through the dated
`Plugin Tutorial <https://wiki.cmsimple-xh.org/archiv/doku.php/plugin_tutorial>`_.
Most of the information in that tutorial still applies,
although you should take any recommendations there with a grain of salt.

The tutorial consists of several chapters which eleborate on individual
concepts of Plib_XH.
Those chapters are based on excerpts of old CMSimple plugins,
to show some real world examples, and to demonstrate how such plugins
could be developed nowadays using Plib_XH and contemporary PHP versions.

Note that the tutorials do not contain *complete* code samples;
for brevity, only code snippets are presented.
