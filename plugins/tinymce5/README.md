# tinymce5_XH - tinyMCEv5 for CMSimple_XH

This is a modified  fork of https://github.com/manu37/tinymce5/     GPL-3.0  - who is the real autor of this plugin.

The git - version gets tinymce from Tinymce-cloud ( CDN ) with Api-Key. To run the CDN Version properly you had to register on https://apps.tiny.cloud/signup/.

*** This is a offline version 5.31 from https://codeload.github.com/tinymce/tinymce-dist/zip/5.3.1 (removed hook from CDN)

For installation just unzip it into the plugins directory - just as tinymce 4 - then change the CMS-editor-field from ckeditor or tinymce4 into tinymce5.

~~The filemanager as we know it is to usable anymore at the moment. For registered user TinyDrive a Cloud filemanager is available. 
Nice, but all your files lie on a remote server.~~ 
Now the generic filebrowser, fontawesome and xh plugincall are usable as tinymce plugins.
