<h2>The TM - History</h2>

<p>Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (* 12. Januar 1918 as Mahesh Verma Shrivastava or <em>Mahesh Prasad Varma</em> in Pounalulla, India; † 5. Februar 2008 in Vlodrop, Netherlands) was&nbsp; just a sadhu and&nbsp; a secretary of Guru Brahmananda Saraswati, the owner of the northern Shankara seat of Jyotirmath of the Indian Shankara Order, who&nbsp; suddenly died of poisoning after 12 years of activity on May 20, 1953. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmananda_Saraswati" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brahmananda Saraswati </a> [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u16wjc01ys0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">video</a>]).</p>

<p>In the left <a href="http://www.paulmason.info/gurudev/TheLastInstruction.html" target="_blank">behind testament</a>, Gurudev Brahmananda Saraswati had named two candidates as successors, but ultimately the council of Shankaracharyas had to decide. There was a dispute over the succession with an indian by the name of Vishnu Devanand Saraswati, who had simply settled himself, which&nbsp; had to be clarified lengthy at court.</p>

<p><span>The <a href="http://www.paulmason.info/gurudev/Shantanand.htm" target="_blank">Swami Shantanand Saraswati</a>, who was desired by Guru Dev,&nbsp; visited Maharishi later during his teacher training in 1961 and was receipted</span> with all ceremony.<strong> </strong>He praised Maharishi that he wanted to spread the Mantrameditation worldwide (at that time still almost costless).<span id="result_box" lang="de"><span> </span></span></p>

<p>He was then until 1980 the chair owner. His successor, Swami <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaroopanand_Saraswati" target="_blank">Swaroopanand Saraswati</a>, was a direct disciple&nbsp; of Gurudev and a harsh critic of Maharishi [3]. He clarified Mr. <a href="?Shankara-Problem">Kropinski about Maharishi</a> in 1987. (There are, however, <a href="http://indology.info/papers/sundaresan/shank-jyot-ascii/" target="_blank">three competing</a> Jyotirmath lines, that is, further the Madhava Asrama and the Krishnabodha Asrama.)</p>

<hr size="1">
<p>Shortly after the sudden death of Guru Brahmananda Saraswati, Maharishi disappeared for two years and stayed mainly in the Himalayas.</p>

<p><span><strong>In 1955, </strong>Maharishi reappeared and tried to spread a transcendental 'deep meditation'.</span><br><span><strong>In 1957</strong>, Maharishi publicly announced his enlightenment.</span></p>

<hr size="1">
<h2>Early history</h2>

<p><strong>1958</strong> the '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation_movement#1958:_Spiritual_Regeneration_Movement_and_Foundation" target="_blank">Spiritual Regeneration Movement</a>' (SRM)&nbsp; was founded in India in Madras, Tamil Nadu.&nbsp; <span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>In 1958 a meditation center in Singapore was also completed.</span> <span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="en"><span>In December 1958 Maharishi visited Honolulu,</span></span> and in 1959 also the USA in California.</p>

<p><span>At first&nbsp; Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was&nbsp; presented by his followers as a reformer, who spread only a simple mantra-meditation, relying brazenly on the holy tradition of his&nbsp; deceased employer Guru Brahmananda Saraswati.</span><strong> </strong>Further :<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u16wjc01ys0" target="_blank"> [Video1] </a>- [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxh2Txy9_C4" target="_blank">Video2</a>] (Youtube)</p>

<p>In what the renewal consisted of remained rather open.&nbsp;<span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>Anyone who knew about yoga and did not let befog himself smiled rather.&nbsp;Maharishi's common slogans were stress reduction and fulfillment and world peace.</span></span></p>

<p>In <strong>1958</strong>, Maharishi <a href="http://www.remid.de/index.php?text=info_tm" target="_blank">visited Europe</a> in England for the first time, and then he began to train initiators of his so-called 'Transcendental Meditation' (trademark).</p>

<p>From <strong>1959</strong> a small fee for the meditation was levied. Maharishi then described a three-year plan with the goal of training 25,000 meditation teachers from 1960 onwards.</p>

<p>The TM-Initiators presented a <a href="?TM-Meditation/TM-PUJA">Puja</a> in front of a painting of the Guru Dev and tried (often in good faith ) to make the impression of a connection to the 'Holy Tradition', - which later <a href="http://alt.tm.universal-path.org/shanem.htm"> rejected </a> Maharishi for several reasons completely after his later worldgovernment plans and the much higher prices and his teachings etc..</p>

<p>After some years the regular meditator had the possibility to get accelerators('Fertilizer') within a paid further initiation, at first a later given up sleeptechnique, and then stepwise at the first <a href="?TM-Meditation/TM-Mantras">mantra</a> attached up to 5 syllables.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The history of the TM movement from 1960 to 1980</h2>
</div>

<p>From 1959 a small fee for the meditation was taken. Maharishi then described a three-year plan with the goal of training 25,000 meditation teachers from 1960 onwards. A well known disciple was <a href="http://www.maharishiphotos.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Charles F. Lutes</a>(1912-2001),&nbsp; a Los Angeles concrete salesman, who was initiated in Transcendental Meditation in 1959. He travelled with Maharishis team several times to open hundreds of meditation centres. In 1969 he became a TM teacher.</p>

<p class="i">Charles was married to Helen (1902-2001), who learnt TM in 1959 with her husband. Maharishi appointed Helen as the first President of his Spiritual Regeneration Movement, SRM.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <strong>1960</strong> Maharishi visited England again, where he lived first in Chelsea and then in the luxurious home of his disciple Henry Nyburg in Wiltshire. He held, among other things, in the Guildhall in Cambridge lectures and founded the 'movement of spiritual renewal of Great Britain' with center in North London.</p>

<p>Afterwards Maharishi traveled to Germany and founded the first group of the <a href="?Current-Issues/Organisation">SRM</a> (Spiritual regeneration movement) and the Sims (Students international meditation service) in Bonn.</p>

<p>People who believed in a renewal despite the content had probably no idea of indian spirituality (at that time a standard) or believed to have found a high guru in the Sari.</p>

<p>In <strong>1964</strong> Maharishi held two courses in the austrian village Obergurgl.</p>

<p><span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>In <strong>1967</strong>, Maharishi spent nearly a year at the <a href="http://www.ilse-eickhoff-akademie.de/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ilse-Eickhoff Academy</a> near Bremen in Germany. </span></span></p>

<div>Mrs. Eickhoff was an experienced esoteric, and she was later seen in the movement as a realization of the 'Mother Divine'. <span>Many followers held Maharishi even later for a Satguru - despite the coming confusions.</span><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/MichaelCooper1967BenMerk.jpg/320px-MichaelCooper1967BenMerk.jpg"><img alt="Author 	Ben Merk (ANEFO)  - CC3 License" class="photo" longdesc="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MichaelCooper1967BenMerk.jpg" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/MichaelCooper1967BenMerk.jpg/320px-MichaelCooper1967BenMerk.jpg" style="margin: 5px; float: right; width: 195px; height: 128px;"></a></div>

<p><span id="result_box" lang="en"></span></p>

<p>In 1967, Maharishi succeeded in interesting the Beatles, who visited him in 1967 in Rishikesh, and soon thereafter (unfortunately ..) produced longplay records like 'Getback' and 'Rubbersoul'.&nbsp; They left him soon just like the Rolling Stones. The beachboys, too, changed their style and produced the LP 'Smiley smile'... Later several other musicians like Mr. Donovan were also attracted, and some stayed with the movement...</p>

<p>In the '68s, Maharishi could score points with his sari and flowers in his hands like others...<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi_%281st_Sept_1967_in_Amsterdam_by_Merk_Ben_from_Nationaal_Archief%29.jpg"><img alt="Author 	Ben Merk (ANEFO)" longdesc="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi_%281st_Sept_1967_in_Amsterdam_by_Merk_Ben_from_Nationaal_Archief%29.jpg" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi_%281st_Sept_1967_in_Amsterdam_by_Merk_Ben_from_Nationaal_Archief%29.jpg" style="margin: 3px 8px; float: right; width: 91px; height: 116px;"></a></p>

<p>In <strong>1968</strong>, his book <em>Meditations of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</em> appeared at Bantam Books [6] with a foreword of Charles F. Lutes, World Governor International Spiritual Regeneration Movement.</p>

<p>In <strong>1969</strong> appeared the german translation of his book "The Science of Being and the Art of Life" (authored translation by Nikolaus Graf Blücher), in which he praised his simple meditation as a panacea for all areas of life.</p>

<p>In <strong>1970</strong>, Maharishi held a course at&nbsp; Kössen in Austria, and soon thereafter also courses in Italy and Spain.</p>

<p>In 1970, the Maharishi also held a TM teacher training course at the Victorian hotel in Poland Springs, Maine, with 1,200 participants. Later he held a similar four-week course with 1500 participants at Humboldt State College in Arcata, California.</p>

<p>In <strong>1974</strong>, Maharishi gave the Neue Züricher Zeitung an interview, in which he described his SCI (Science of Creative Intelligence) as the solution to all problems. The TM - movement bought the castle hotel of the suisse village Seelisberg at the Vierwaldstädter See, where Maharishi parallel resided there in a house of his own. <a href="?TM-History/1980-2000">1983</a> Mahrishi left Seelisberg in direction&nbsp; Netherlands.</p>

<hr size="1">
<h2>The TM - Initiation (Inauguration ceremony)</h2>

<p>The TM initiator presents a puja at the <a href="?TM-Meditation/Steps-of-Initiation">meditation - inauguration - ceremony</a> before the painting of Guru Dev and attempts to arouse the false impression of the connection to the guru dev and his holy tradition. But Maharishi is completely rejected for several reasons inclusive his wordgovernment-plans. He could not prove a mission&nbsp; from Guru Dev. His teachings are very different from Shankaras Advaita vedanta and from Smarta Sampradaya.</p>

<p>"Ashtanga Yoga : Yama, niyam, aasan, praanayaam, pratyaahaar, dhaarnaa, dhyaan, samaadhi. These are the eight limbs of yoga. A guru takes a student one by one through them. For this, the Guru takes NICHTS from his disciple. He does it out of kindness and from the feeling of doing something good for his student. " Shree Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, 1987</p>

<p>First there was probably only one mantra 'Aing' (after <a href="?Shankara-Problem">Kropinski</a>) for all. From 1968 there were probably already three <a href="?TM-Meditation/TM-Mantras">mantras</a> (Richrad Blakely: The secret of the mantras).</p>

<p>After years the regular practitioner could get several so-called accelerators (fertilizer) for a paid initiation, which consisted at first of a sleep technique that was later redrawn, and then of stepwise added syllables to the first mantra (eg 'aing namah').</p>

<hr size="1">
<h2>SCI - Science of creative intelligence</h2>

<p>In the 70s Maharishi began to spread his laugable "<a href="?SCI">Science of the Creative Intelligence</a>," which is still part of the course offers in internal courses, and the movement tried to present Maharishi as a physicist (with a degree at the Allahabad University in 1942).</p>

<p>Thereto the sect presented an irrational psycho-physical worldview with various indian goddesses (such as Durga, Brahma, Saraswati, Indra) and the so-called '<a href="?SCI-Pseudoscience/Natural-law">natural law</a>' and a unified field as a basis of all things - with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mysticism" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">false relation</a> to modern Quantumphysics.</p>

<p>A doctor Wallace had published measurements of scalp currents on TM meditators and identified elevated alpha waves (Wallace, R.K.: Physiological effects of Transcendental Meditation, 1970), which were referred to everywhere, and which were often interpreted as a 4th state of consiousness(turiya) or even as a sign of yoga - samadhi.</p>

<p>In particular, alpha waves and <a href="?SCI-Pseudoscience/Coherence">coherence</a> are no proof of transcendence or even of samadhi states, as in Ashtanga yoga, but merely a sign of deep relaxation. Electrical potential changes can also occur with Chinese respiratory exercises. In&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vipassana</a> gamma waves are increased.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/neuro-experiment-moenche-in-der-magnetroehre-1.912829" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Recent research</a> in this regard is rather for gamma waves. Gamma waves are a higher-order control frequencies, which synchronizes and merge the brain areas. They also appear during lucid dreaming. Thus perceptions but also states of consciousness arise.</p>

<p>From a scientific point of view, there is no transcendental awareness - despite all US doctoral theses and interpreted and partly <a href="?SCI-Pseudoscience/Crackpot-Science">fake measurements</a> and studies on the part of the TM movement. From the point of view of science, it is always a question of interpretations or of intuitions, which, of course, is no disproof of the non-existence of&nbsp; spiritual bodies etc..</p>

<p>Also, this meditation does not quickly allow the spiritual experience of his "own being", i.e. to be a mirror of pure consciousness (whatever that is, at least the experienced is not the Hindu CHIT or even an Ishvara samadhi of the Asthanga yoga) or not to cultivate this experience permanently, since the human being is not spiritual (like the Jivatma is) with a few exceptions but must gradually develop in this respect.</p>

<p>Transcendental consciousness is at least the hindu Buddhist plane(Maharloka), on which a beginner does not have a body, which he has to build up by a long time yoga-practice, which must seem curious to the unprepared average man('body?').</p>

<p>Transcendental consciousness is not only a deep state of "restful alertness." Transcendental consciousness means "standing in the stream," in the lower Pranava. Spiritual consciousness, on the other hand, is at the same time visionary. There is therefore no real spiritual materialism but there is a so-called black path(black Tantra)</p>

<p><span><strong>In 1974</strong></span> Maharishi postulated that the quality of life would improve appreciably (...and of course his revenues ...), if 1 per cent of the word population would practice his Transcendental Meditation technique.</p>

<p>This was&nbsp; propagated as the "<a href="?SCI-Pseudoscience/Maharishi-effect">Maharishi Effect</a>" (alleged improved <a href="?SCI-Pseudoscience/Coherence">coherence</a> in world consciousness). According to Maharishi, this effect was observed in 1974 in 16 cities according to an analysis of criminal statistics.</p>

<p><span lang="de"><span></span></span>The author Ted Karam, for example, wrote that there are numerous studies on the Maharishi effect, which include a gathering of more than 4000 people in Washington DC in the summer of 1993 (Karam, Ted: Jumping on Water, Awaken Your Joy, Empower Your Life, 2005). <span lang="de"><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Finally, he met Guru Muktananda from southindian Siddha Yoga in Switzerland and had a lively exchange. But he let the band recordings with Muktananda destroy soon after.</p>

<p>Maharishi had since 1959 kept open the possibility of obtaining the Siddhis mentioned in Patanjalis Yogasutras, but Patanjali warnes in his Yogasutras against the binding effects of such forces.</p>

<p>Maharishi then put the formulas of Patanjali to the test with a small group of meditators, attracting over 1,000 aspirants. However, it lacked a demonstration of such magical abilities. After completing a Siddhi course, the title of an 'Executive Governor of Consciousness' waved.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on 'current research', Maharishi announced in 1977 the 'Year of the Ideal Society'.</p>

<p><strong>1977 </strong>a US district court decided that a curriculum in TM and in the '<a href="?SCI">Science of Creative Intelligence</a>' (SCI) in some New Jersey schools&nbsp; was religious in its own and violated the first constitutional amendment, and that Maharishis&nbsp; SCI doctrine is not a science but a religion <font face="arial, sans-serif">(Malnak v. Yogi, 440 F.Supp. 1284 (1977), affirmed, 592 F.2d 197 (3rd Cir. 1979). -- </font>s.a.:<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/donandmarcy/guruworld.html" target="_blank">Guruworld</a>).</p>

<h2>MUM - Maharishi University of Managemnent</h2>

<p>Another blinding step was the founding of a university for management (<a href="?Current-Issues/MUM">MUM</a>), which still exists today in a modified form in Iowa. <a href="/?Licenses"><img alt="" class="photo" id="Pulic domain" longdesc="/?Licenses" src="./userfiles/images/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi_during_a_1979_visit_to_MUM.jpg" style="margin: 5px; float: right; width: 143px; height: 180px;" title="Author  Author Keithbob at English Wikipedia"></a><br>The fact is that <a href="?Current-Issues/MUM" target="_blank">MUM</a> is not recognized in germany and other countries as university. A main theme is the <a href="http://www.mum.edu/about-mum/consciousness-based-education/" target="_blank">consciousness-based education</a>.</p>

<h2>The history of the TM movement from 1980 to 2000</h2>

<p>Steps of the development of the movement&nbsp; <a href="?TM-History/1980-2000">in the 80es</a> were</p>

<ul>
    <li>1983 : The(failed) '<a href="?Current-Issues/Worldgovernment">government of the age of enlightenment</a>' publishes an international appeal in magazines to several governments to solve their problems</li>
    <li>The initiator Robert Kropinski became suspicious and visited the Shankara Order in India and received a sobering view of Maharishi. Mr. Kropinski then <a href="http://minet.org/www.trancenet.net/personal/40.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> litigated in the USA</a> with success and <a href="http://icsahome.com/infoserv_respond/by_studyguide.asp?Subject=Jury+Awards+%24138%2C000+Against+TM+for+Fraud+and+Negligence+%26+Variant+Views+of+TM" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> 1987</a> because of unfulfilled promises.</li>
    <li>Unproven 'Siddhis'(yogic flying) and expensive courses, <a href="http://www.invincibledefense.org/action.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">invincible defense</a>, unified field and the '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Law_Party" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> nature law party</a>' and the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAM" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> 'RAAM'</a> - currency of the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Country_of_World_Peace" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Global country of worldpeace</a>' and an unproven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_Effect" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> 'Maharishi effect' </a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Worldgovernment of the age of enlightenment</h2>

<p>In 1980, Maharishi returned from <a href="http://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/schweizer-geschichte/die-fliegenden-yogis-von-seelisberg-1.18473566" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Seelisberg</a> to India and established the <a href="http://www.maharishiinstituteofmanagement.com/mnagar-camp.jsp" target="_blank">Maharishi Nagar</a> (<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi_Vedic_University" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MMYVV</a>) as the Indian center of the movement near New Delhi<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Other centers were created in <a href="http://www.mum.edu/about/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fairfield (Iowa 52557,USA)</a> and in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MERU,_Holland" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Netherlands</a>(MERU - Vlodrop).</p>

<p>In India (<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi_Vedic_University" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MMYVV</a>)&nbsp; is a ground for such mass movements, especially when it is connected with livelihood and jobs. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twZRwVOmDxY" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Video of 2011 !</a>]</p>

<p>After all, Maharishi opened the long-planned "<a href="?Current-Issues/Worldgovernment">World Government of the Age of Enlightenment</a>" - with ministers and governors and Rajas<span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>.</span></span></p>

<p>In 1983 appeard in the german STERN magazine (R) and also international a full-page advertisement in which the '<a href="?Current-Issues/Worldgovernment">World Government of the Age of Enlightenment</a>' invited all governments to solve their problems. The payment needed first take place after the achievement, etc.. In the process one relied even boldly on Guru Dev Brahmananda Sarasvati.</p>

<p>At that time, thousands of meditators believed to be enlightened, since rumors were in circulation for many years, with the TM - meditation one would be enlightened within 5-7 years (besides <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdOPYfSxRRI&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">kosmic consciousness</a> - s.a.: <a href="http://sekten-info-nrw.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=122&amp;Itemid=46" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reller, 2000</a>, S. 794).</p>

<hr size="1">
<h2>Yogic (Pseudo or illusory)-Flyers</h2>

<p><span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>In 1986 Maharishi added a fake <a href="?Yogic-pseudo-flying">siddhi-flying</a> within the</span><span> so-called Siddhi program with its expensive preparatory courses, - which still has not been given up.&nbsp; At first the foam rubber mats were not visible in the photos.</span></span></p>

<p><span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>It turned out, however, during the expensive courses that it was about muscle contractions on thick mats with the <a href="http://www.icsahome.com/system/app/pages/search?scope=search-site&amp;q=maharishi" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lazy prominse(USA-court)</a> of later hovering.&nbsp; <span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>True hovering could not be demonstrated so far (---&gt; <a href="http://www.agpf.de/TM-Flieger-ReportMuenchen-10.5.2004-Video.avi" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hopping video</a> of the magazine 'Report' Munich 2004).</span></span> </span></span></p>

<p><span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en"><span>In 1986, Maharishis published his next book</span></span> '<span class="fn"><span dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.de/Enlightenment-Thirty-Years-Around-World/dp/9071750019" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Thirty Years Around the World</a>: 1957-1964 ,</span></span><span dir="ltr"> Stichting Drukkerij en Uitgeverij MVU.</span></p>

<p><span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>After the <a href="http://www.agpf.de/Bundesverwaltungsgericht7c2-87.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">judgment of the German Federal</a> Administrative Court of 1989, which also became the basis of later <a href="http://www.agpf.de/Inhalt.htm#Recht" rel="noopener" target="_blank">judgments</a> against the sect, Mahrishi moved the Guru Dev somewhat from the center and swerved on the old Veda and <a href="?Veda/Ayurveda">Ayur-Veda</a>, which Shankara had replaced by&nbsp; Advaita-Vedanta,</span> <span>and Maharishi propagated a so-called <a href="http://maharishi-programmes.globalgoodnews.com/vedic-science/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vedic science</a>.</span></span></p>

<p><span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>In Ayurveda were at first turmoils caused by looking and lack of competence.</span></span></p>

<h2><img alt="" src="./userfiles/images/qa3.jpg" style="float: left; width: 10px; height: 10px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;">&nbsp; The case Kropinski</h2>

<p>Finally, a suspicious TM initiator, Robert Kropinski, visited the Shankara Order and received a&nbsp;<a href="?Shankara-Problem">disillusioning description</a> of Maharishi, which he recorded and published in <strong>1987</strong> in 'The Illustrated Weekly of India'.</p>

<p>Mr. Kropinski <span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>complained before the court</span></span> in the USA <a href="http://minet.org/www.trancenet.net/personal/40.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">with success</a>, and in 1987 also because of <a href="http://minet.org/Documents/pat-ryan" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unfulfilled prpmises.</a></p>

<p>In <strong>1990</strong>, the Maharishi relocated his headquarters from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seelisberg" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Seelisberg">Seelisberg</a>, Switzerland, to a former Franciscan monastery in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlodrop" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Vlodrop">Vlodrop</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, which became known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MERU,_Holland" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="MERU, Holland">MERU - Holland</a>, on account of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_European_Research_University" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Maharishi European Research University">Maharishi European Research University</a> (MERU) campus there. After 2000 Maharishi dwelled mainly there.</p>

<h2><img alt="" src="./userfiles/images/qa3.jpg" style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; float: left; width: 10px; height: 10px;">&nbsp; Scientists and crowned Rajas</h2>

<p>In 1984, the sect succeeded to win the physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hagelin" target="_blank">John Hagelin</a>, who had worked at CERN and SLAC, and who was then crowned as '<a href="http://tmfree.blogspot.de/2009/04/john-hagelin-in-high-weirdness-mode.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Raja of the Invincible America</a>' and now has a leading position in the TM-Movement, for the 'unified field theory' propagated by Maharishi.</p>

<div>But Maharishis unified field theory(<a href="?SCI-Pseudoscience/Maharishi-effect">Maharishi effect</a>) contradicts all Hindu plane models, and modern physics tries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to approach it</a> in a different form. [Battling or Consicousness: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrcWntw9juM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prof Hagelin on Youtube</a>]</div>

<p>"Field effect as the effect of coherence and positivity caused by the field of infinite interaction; so-called (unproven) 'Maharishi effect' as a field effect of consciousness on the level of the unified field of all natural laws, the field of transcendental consciousness that permeates every life" - ie lots of exaggerated fancy.</p>

<p>Other terms were "Quantum Consciousness, Quantum Miracles" (and <a href="http://www.skepdic.com/chopra.html" target="_blank">quantum healing</a>).</p>

<p>How the degree of a TM - Fairfield University's doctor looks like can be seen from this.</p>

<p><span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>In 2000 the Lebanese neurology professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Nader" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Toni Nader</a> was crowned as the supreme ruler of the '<a href="?Current-Issues/Global-Country">Global Coutry</a> of World Peace', who had published a "study" of planetary impacts, and who had <a href="http://maharishi-programmes.globalgoodnews.com/vedic-science/img/research/nader-raam-scale.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sat down on&nbsp; a large weighing scale</a> and had received his own weight in gold.</span></span></p>

<p>Soon afterwards the sect selled an expensive coronation to a Raja.[see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbsbTn8mt94" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Video !</a>]</p>

<hr size="1">
<h2>Nature law party</h2>

<p>Ein Ableger der Sekte ist auch die noch in Österreich und <a href="http://www.natural-law.org/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in den USA</a> bestehende <a href="http://www.agpf.de/TM-Naturgesetz-Partei.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Naturgesetzpartei</a> [<a href="http://www.bewusstseinstechnologie.de/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MWS</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOpbZC9Gk-U" target="_blank"> &gt;&gt; Video !</a>; <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/wiki/%C3%96NP" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wiki</a>]<br>Das Wort "Siddhi" bedeutet angeblich im Sanskrit "Vollkommenheit" und 'höhere Kräfte', so dass laut Werbung mittels des TM-Sidhi-Programms eine im normalen Wachbewusstsein unbekannte Meisterschaft über die Naturgesetze erlangt werden könne und der einzelne gleichzeitig in immer intensiveren Einklang mit den Naturgesetzen im eigenen Denken und Handeln gelangt.</p>

<h4><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhi#Hinduismus" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Siddhis</a></h4>

<p>bezeichnen im Hinduismus besondere schwer erreichbare übernatürliche Kräfte und Fähigkeiten, die man gemäß der Überlieferung z.B.&nbsp; durch&nbsp;<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samyama" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Samyama"> Samyama</a> Praxis erlangt, vor denen Pantanjali aber warnt und nicht wie oft fälschlicherweise behauptet dazu Anweisungen gibt, und die in ihrer gewöhnlichen Form eher dem <a href="http://wiki.yoga-vidya.de/Tantra" rel="noopener" target="_blank">schwarzen Tantra</a> zuzuordnen sind.</p>

<p>Since the 80ies the Shankara-Order does not accept Maharishi&nbsp; and rejects him. Maharishi was only the secretary of <a href="http://www.paulmason.info/gurudev/gurudev.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Guru Dev</a> and a sadhu and not a initiated disciple. Guru Dev, who died from poison, had wanted two other persons as successor, and there is no proof that Guru Dev was a fully enlightened master (Unity).</p>

<p>Maharishis teachings inclusive the <a href="?TM-Meditation" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Transcendental Meditation</a> and the siddhis are very different from the traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advaita-Vedanta</a> -Teachings of the Shankara-Order, and he does not represent the "Holy tradition" (and i am fully convinced that he is a black master or Rudra-master !).</p>

<p>The (alleged) siddhis are in claring contradiction to the teachings of the <a href="http://www.sringerisharadapeetham.org/jagadgurus/bharati_tirtha.php" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> order</a>, and even Pantanjali warns before them.</p>

<p>* Wiki : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Transcendental_Meditation" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> TM-History</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of the nineties Maharishi moved the Guru Dev somewhat into the background and turned to Veda, which Shankara had once superseeded with 'Advaita' because of the many errors which had crept into traditional Veda, and to <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Maharishi_Ayurveda" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ayurveda</a> and Siddhis like doubtful yogic "flying"(Superfoam hopping), 'peace'-<a href="http://www.maharishipeacepalace.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> palaces</a> and '<a href="http://www.consciousnessbasededucation.org.uk/MaharishiSchools.shtml" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> invincibility</a>'(-towers)...<br><br>At the 6. February 2008 Maharishi died - after he had said he had met Guru Devs alleged mission.<br>Since then is Maharaja Adhiraj Rajaraam <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tony_Nader" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Tony Nader</a> president[who had <a href="http://maharishi-programmes.globalgoodnews.com/vedic-science/img/research/nader-raam-scale.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> received his weight in gold</a>].</p>

<p>From <strong>TM-EX Newsletter</strong>, Volume 4, Number 1, Winter, 1992 INDIA A Visit to the Shankaracharya</p>

<p>Introduction: Over a thousand years ago(1), Adi Shankara, renowned for his revival of the knowledge of Vedic Sanatan Dharma or the worship of God, according to the Vedic Scriptures, and also for his commentaries on several major Hindu Scriptures, established four major monasteries in India. These monasteries, or ``Maths'' were located in the North, South, East and Western parts of India. These Maths or ``Peeths'' (monasteries) were overseen by ``Shankaracharyas'' according to the tradition and wishes prescribed by Adi Shankara.</p>

<p>Shankara was also widely accepted in India as the descension of Lord Shiva, the Hindu deity responsible for the final dissolution of the universe. The primary responsibility of each of the four Shankaracharyas, while overseeing the four Maths, has been the preservation of the major systems of Hindu philosophy which form the basis of the Hindu religion. Within the monasteries, the Shankaracharyas took disciples, who in some cases, assumed the revered title of Shankaracharya upon the death of their Spiritual Master. Those Shankaracharyas travelled extensively throughout India preaching their particular sect's beliefs to all Hindus.</p>

<p>The title ``Shankaracharya'' is a traditional title handed down to that person, who according to Adi Shankara, the original Shankaracharya, is Brahmin by birth, established in Yoga, or in other words, whose soul is in union with God and who is thereby Divine. Having achieved this union through lifetimes of spiritual practice and renunciation, now, as living Divinity, he is ``pujapad,'' his feet are worthy of worship. <strong><span color="#0000A0" size="4" style="color: #0000a0; font-size: medium;"> His scriptural understanding is so perfect that he can synthesize the scriptures of all Religions. </span></strong> He is Vedanta Incarnate, the embodiment of Hindu Scripture, and further, he must be recognized as Shankaracharya by the other three Shankaracharyas, having received proper initiation by them according to Hindu Scriptural injunctions. Recognized also means that the other Shankaracharyas are willing to sit alongside him at major religious festivals.</p>

<p>According to the rules laid down by Shankara, the only possibility of removing a Shankaracharya is, if, during his lifetime he should become mentally infirm or prove by his actions or judgment that he is not qualified to hold the title which is held sacred by Hindus. If such a case exists, a new Shankaracharya is elected by a learned body of pundits, called ``Kashi Vidwat Parishad,'' according to the tradition. In this way, the title of Shankaracharya and these Maths or monasteries have been maintained and handed down from Master to Disciple for thousands of years. This lineage is commonly known as the ``Shankaracharya Tradition.''</p>

<p>PART I</p>

<p>In October 1986, several months before my case against the Transcendental Meditation movement was to begin in Washington, D.C., I contacted Shree Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati. Shree Shankaracharya, reported and pictured in The Illustrated Weekly of India(2), has the unique distinction of holding the dual title, Jagadguru Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math (Jyotish Peeth Monastery) of Northern India, as well as the Shankaracharya of the Dwarka Math in Western India.</p>

<p>Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati was a pre-eminent disciple of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (Guru Dev). Brahmananda Saraswati, whose picture is customarily seen behind Mahesh Yogi, was also Mahesh Yogi's Spiritual Master. Guru Dev held the title of Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, the monastery located in Northern India, until his death, by poisoning, in 1954.</p>

<p>My interest in contacting the Shankaracharya was to attempt to discern whether or not, from the Shankaracharya's understanding of Indian Scripture, I had been misled by Mahesh Yogi. Further, as a teacher of TM, I wanted to know if, in fact, I represented the Shankaracharya Tradition as I had been told by Mahesh Yogi. Most of all, it was an attempt to find out what had happened to my mind from the practice of TM and the TM Sidhi programs.</p>

<p>The Shankaracharya, Swaroopanand Saraswati, had been invited to attend a five day birthday celebration of Guru Dev's oldest living disciple, Swami Akandananda, at the Akandananda ashram in the town of Vrindaban, India. A great tent and stage had been erected to hold several thousand guests. These guests included Shantinand (seen pictured to the right of the Shankaracharya Swaroopanand) and Vishnu Devanand (not pictured with the Shankaracharya), both of whom had previously attempted to lay claim to the title of Shankaracharya of the Northern seat.</p>

<p>When I arrived in Vrindaban, I settled into a hotel, then made my way to Akandananda's ashram. There were several hundred people listening to a speech on the Vedas. After making some inquiries, I quickly learned that Shankaracharya had not yet arrived, but was given the address of the house at which he was staying. I visited with the family and left my name and hotel address, hoping that Shankaracharya would contact me when he arrived.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, one of Shankaracharya's devotees brought word that he had arrived in the middle of the night and I was to come at lunchtime. Arriving at the house, I was taken to a side courtyard. Having removed my shoes according to custom, my host requested that I bathe my hands and feet prior to being taken to Shankaracharya's bedroom. Finally, the moment had arrived. I was taken down a long corridor and ushered into a bedroom. Shankaracharya was sitting crosslegged on the bed. He spoke in Hindi, pointing to one of his disciples dressed in orange. As he spoke, his disciple began translating. Shankaracharya asked my name and if I was the same gentleman who had contacted him. He asked if I had eaten and motioned to one of his disciples to serve me lunch, and we would talk again later. A traditional Indian lunch was served in the courtyard. By this time, about fifty people were at the house, including his disciples, dignitaries and local government officials who had come to receive his darshan and to welcome him to Vrindaban.</p>

<p>After resting in the afternoon, Shankaracharya once again summoned me to his room. There were about twenty people in the room sitting on the floor. After bowing in customary fashion to show my respect, I was asked to relate my questions to Shankaracharya. I began by telling him how I had started practicing TM, met Mahesh Yogi (as Shankaracharya called him), and had eventually become a teacher of TM. In particular, I read statements from TM literature saying TM came from the Shankaracharya tradition. I then read aloud the famous statement which was allegedly written by a Shankaracharya, which described Mahesh Yogi as the protector of the Shankaracharya Tradition, Rishi of Rishis and a descension of Shankara himself. I explained that these kinds of statements were used on courses and during fundraisers by TM officials to garner financial and emotional support from TM members. Further, I spoke aloud the sixteen mantras: eng, em, enga, ema, aing, aim, ainga, aima, shiring, shirim, hiring, hirim, kiring, kirim, shyam and shyama, and the method of giving them by age as I had been taught by Mahesh Yogi. Next came the advanced techniques. Finally, I described the TM Sidhi Program.</p>

<p>Shankaracharya looked physically distressed and his bowed head shook from side to side as the statements were translated. Then, after what seemed to be an eternal silence, he began to speak. He stated that his Master had left a will which clearly stated the names of those individuals who were to assume the title and responsibilities of Shankaracharya after his death. After the murder of his Master, the next in line was Shantinand. He said Mahesh immediately had him moved into the ashram to assume authority. Then, [Mahesh] used [Shantinand's] name after leaving India, to show that he taught under the authority of Shankaracharya.</p>

<p>In the meantime, he (Swaroopanand) said he had been given the title of Shankaracharya of Dwarka Math and travelled extensively throughout India preaching. He recalled that Shantinand did not have the proper training or credentials to hold the title of Shankaracharya, and eventually, after proving himself unfit to hold the title, the same learned pundits who had elected Brahmananda Saraswati to the throne asked Swaroopanand to take the title and responsibilities of the Jyotir Math ashram, until such time as another qualified person could be appointed. He agreed, and was given initiation as Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math.</p>

<p>Shantinand, at the direction of Mahesh Yogi, refused to give up possession of the Jyotir Math ashram and forced the matter into litigation. Years later, Shantinand finally gave up the title and Mahesh had Vishnu Devanand assume the title and possession of the ashram. In so doing, they also clearly ignored the will of Guru Dev which had specified the name Dvarikeshanand Saraswati as the second in line to receive the title. This was to occur, according to the will of Guru Dev, should Shantinand prove unqualified or leave the ashram. Swaroopanand continued, stating, it was written by my Lord (Guru Dev) that ``this is my will and command.'' He said that the scheme by Mahesh to appoint Vishnu Devanand was clearly gross disrespect of his own Master's desire. He said all of this was being done to delude Westerners. Mahesh needs a Shankaracharya to continue spreading his net of deception. He said, as Shankaracharya, it is my clear and absolute duty to uphold the true teaching of Shree Shankara.</p>

<p>Fact is fact, he stated, these things you have described to me have nothing to do with the Shankaracharya Tradition. The so-called mantras or meaningless sounds as you have described them are primarily used to gain material wealth and comfort, not for spiritual enlightenment. Further, my Master (Guru Dev) never gave the mantras you have described, his mantras were not mantras for material comfort, his were to uplift the soul, remove his material attachments and for realization of God.</p>

<p>He invited me to attend the meeting with him in the tent that evening. As he entered the tent, a loud voice announced the entrance of Shree Swaroopanand Saraswati, Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth and Shankaracharya of Dwarka Peeth. There were now about 2,000 people in attendance. All prostrated as he entered the tent, walked on stage and assumed the throne of Shree Shankaracharya.</p>

<p>He gave discourse on the special teaching responsibilities of Shankaracharya and those who claim they belong to the Tradition. He described how the world, particularly the West, had no understanding of Indian spiritual traditions or Scriptures. Further, he stated to mislead Westerners was a grave insult to India and to those Westerners who relied on such misrepresentations.</p>

<p>I returned that evening to Shankaracharya's house and was immediately taken to see him. He asked, did you see Shantinand on the stage? I replied yes. He said, word came to me that he (Shantinand) had requested to be allowed on the stage. I allowed him to be present only because he has given up this nonsense of claiming title to Shankaracharya. He said Vishnu Devanand, Mahesh's so-called Shankaracharya, was also here in Vrindaban, he also requested to come onto the stage, but I refused. Then, he (Vishnu Devanand) stated he would sit on a lower, undecorated seat if I allowed him to attend. I refused him. Then, he again begged to simply sit on the floor of the stage at my feet, if I allowed him to be publicly present. Again I refused. He said, if I allow him to be seen with me, and all the while wrongfully claiming title as Shankaracharya, it will appear as if I approve of his activity, and I do not. Therefore, he said, I have ordered that he may not even come into the tent to sit in the audience.</p>

<p>He went on the describe how some mentally disturbed man in India had put on saffron robes and claimed to be a Shankaracharya. He said he travelled throughout India and gathered a few disciples who innocently were being deceived and who followed him. He said, anyone can build a throne, put on orange robes and claim the title of Shankaracharya--who would stop them? However, the true test of the title is whether the other Shankaracharyas, who initiate the new Shankaracharya, will sit publicly with him. During special spiritual ceremonies, all Shankaracharyas must be present and sit together. He said no other Shankaracharya will publicly sit with Vishnu Devanand, nor would he.</p>

<p>Shankaracharya then warned me that Mahesh now knows you are here in Vrindaban with me. He has sent Nadikishor and his spies here with others to watch you, you must be very careful. He placed a guard outside of my bedroom door at night and had someone travel with me at all times. Much to my amazement, I discovered that, in fact, I was being followed.</p>

<p>The next time, we met with the local press present. There he wanted the world to bear witness against the gross misrepresentations and disrespect which was being perpetrated against the Shankaracharya Tradition. On a warm Autumn evening, in Vrindaban, India, he answered the following questions, which I and others asked him. Robert Kropinski~</p>

<p>From <strong>TM-EX Newsletter</strong>, Volume 4, Number 2, Spring, 1992</p>
<p>INDIA -- A Visit to the Shankaracharya, Part II</p>
<p>On a warm Autumn evening, in Vrindaban, India, he answered the following questions which I and others asked him:</p>
<p>[The following transcript is taken directly from the taped conversations. Translations were provided concurrently by an interpreter.]</p>
<p><strong>Questioner: </strong> The religion that Guru Dev (Mahesh's teacher) preached was connected with five forms of God--Devatas--such as Pancha Devupasana and so what relation has it with Vedic Sanatan Dharma (worship of God) as well as in regard to the ``Varna'' (caste system) and ``Aashram'' (four stages of life) systems?</p>
<p><strong>Shankaracharya: </strong> The Lord, Adi Shankara was a great exponent of Vedic Sanatan Dharma. God, he taught, is grouped into six forms. He preached six types--five based on forms of God like Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, etc. and one, Nirakar, without form. However, the worship of God without form being extremely difficult was reserved for renunciates. That is what Adi Shankaracharya had instructed.</p>
<p>Bhagavan Shree Shankara revived Vedic Sanatan Dharma. He said God has six forms. So accordingly, Maharaji (Guru Dev) gave ``upadesh'' (initiation) to meditate upon those forms for the sake of our worship.</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> My Lord, Shankaracharya Brahmananda Saraswatiji Maharaj (Guru Dev), who is our ``pujapaad'' (whose feet are worthy of our respect), who is ``brahmaleen'' (absorbed in Brahma, the omnipresent form of God) who is presiding over the Jyotish, who is the teacher of the entire universe--that he (Guru Dev) used to instruct mantras to his disciples. I would like to know which mantras were those?</p>
<p><strong>Shankaracharya: </strong> The Lord, Shankaracharya Brahmananda Saraswatiji Maharaj (Guru Dev) strictly adhered to the ``Varna'' (caste) and ``Aashram'' (four stages of life) systems. He believed in one's Varna (caste) by birth. Whosoever came to him to become a disciple, he used to ask him which form of God he was in love with. Whichever form the new disciple had an interest in, that form he would explain to the new disciple. [Guru Dev] used to explain, Either you should depend on your own inclination or else, he, after understanding your previous life and which form of God you worshipped then, would instruct the initiate accordingly.</p>
<p>Without having an ``IshTadevataa'' (a personal form of God), no one could have a ``Mantra'' (name of God) from him. The very meaning of Mantra is IshTadevataa (a personal form of God). Therefore, along with every mantra, thinking or reflecting over the form of the IshTadevataa is essential. Therefore, in all the modes of worship, one reflects over one's IshTadevataa before chanting or meditating with one's mantra.</p>
<p><strong>Questioner </strong>(to interpreter): Can you explain to Maharaji (The Shankaracharya) that I was trained by Mahesh Yogi as a teacher of TM, and I can explain to him what I was taught. I don't understand whether or not what I was taught is correct. Explain to him that I was given 16 mantras, by Maharishi that I can pronounce to Maharaji. I will pronounce them one after the other as I was trained. They are to be given out by certain ages. I can read them to Maharaji and then he can comment whether they are correct or incorrect. If he can explain how they are supposed to be used, or whether they are supposed to be used or not. Eng, em, enga, ema, aing, aim, ainga, aima, hiring, hirim, kiring, kirim, shiring, shirim, shyam, shyama.</p>
<p><strong>Shankaracharya:</strong> It's like this. Here we have each mantra connected with one god. There lies the bija mantra. That bija mantra is for that god.</p>
<p><strong>Questioner:</strong> Mahesh Yogi's mantras are of one [sound] each, for instance, eng, em, enga, ema, aing, aim, etc. These are given by age or sex. This is not the teachings of the Vedas or Scriptures, what is your opinion?</p>
<p><strong>Shankaracharya:</strong> We do join Bija Aksharas (single syllabled names/sounds) to the mantras. But, Bija Aksharas also mean IshTadevataas (names of the personal forms of god). The kind of process you just described is purely imaginary and it has no connection with our Scripture of the Shankaracharya tradition.</p>
<p>Bija Akshara is connected with IshTadevataas to make it a mantra. These have relevance with the Scriptures, a tradition. Whatever Mahesh does in this respect has no relevance to Shastra (Scriptures).</p>

<p>[Editor's note: The Author is a former teacher of TM. He filed a lawsuit against the TM movement on the grounds of fraud, which was settled out of court in 1991. After leaving the TM movement in 1983 he joined another Eastern group, International Society of Divine Love, ISDL. He has since left ISDL, and is no longer interested in pursuIng his spiritual life under the control of a guru.]</p>

<p>INDIA</p>

<p>A Visit to the Shankaracharya, Part III</p>

<p>[Editor's Note: The following transcript is taken directly from the taped conversations between Robert Kropinski, a former TM teacher and follower of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and Shree Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, a pre-eminent disciple of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (Guru Dev), who is considered Mahesh Yogi's Spiritual Master.]</p>

<p><strong>Qestioner:</strong>: So, in other words, explain to Shankaracharya, that what he (Mahesh) gives is, for example, my mantra was aing, and I paid $400 and I received the word ``aing.'' So, mentally, I closed my eyes with aing, using that mantra, repeating it mentally, passively. In other words, passively, just saying it, repeating it like that. Mahesh claims these mantras came from Shankaracharya.</p>

<p><strong>Shankaracharya:</strong> Shankaracharya (Guru Dev), whose disciple he (Mahesh) calls himself, I was also his disciple, Brahmand Saraswati's (Guru Dev). He (Brahmand Saraswati) was my Guru. He would not accept any offerings from his disciples.</p>

<p>Disciple should be such that he gives to his Guru everything. Then nothing belongs to the disciple, everything is Guru's. Guru should be such that he does not take anything from the disciple. He thinks only good of his disciple.</p>

<p><strong>Qestioner:</strong>: Lord, we have heard that Mahesh Yogi instructs mantras himself, and some people believe him as their Guru. He is a kaaystha by birth (lower caste). Do you think it is appropriate for him to instruct like this?</p>

<p><strong>Shankaracharya:</strong> My first information was that he used to place a picture of Guru Dev and had people worship the picture, and then he would give out the mantras. I have met many persons who, in reality, had their mantras from Mahesh, but they consider themselves to be disciples of Brahmaliin Jagadguru Shankaracharya (Guru Dev). But, no matter whom they consider their teacher, the fact of the matter is that a person who gives a mantra is to be considered the real Guru. If Mahesh thinks that he is backed by Shankaracharya, then what is proper on his part is to tell people to take initiation from Shankaracharya.</p>

<p><strong>Qestioner:</strong> Brahmananda Saraswati did not charge any fees when he used to initiate?</p>

<p><strong>Shankaracharya:</strong>This is a principle. A quotation from Goswami Tulsidas: ``The guru who charges or takes money from his disciples in return for initiation, steals disciples property and goes to damnable hell.''</p>

<p>For that reason Guru Deva used to give `upadesha' (initiation) without any fees. He used to say ``If I accept any gift from the disciple (or fees), then his sins are transmitted to me.'' In India, dharma, yoga, knowledge, specialized knowledge can never be sold for money. That is priceless. Anyone who puts a price on it insults it. So, a mantra is also never given for money. Knowledge cannot be sold for money. Therefore, the process that is being employed by Mahesh is merely for the sake of making money, and this is entirely against the canons of Indian culture and civilization.<a name="ans"></a></p>

<p>Where money is involved that becomes a business.</p>

<p>I am telling you what is good for you without any vested interest. This is the rule followed here. We do not have a class of people as he (Mahesh) has created there...You don't need a class for giving a mantra.</p>

<center><img border="0" height="8" src="http://alt.tm.universal-path.org/violin.gif" width="722"></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

<p><strong>Ashtanga Yoga</strong>--Yama, niyam, aasan, praanayaam, pratyaahaar, dhaarnaa, dhyaan, samaadhi, theses are the eight limbs of yoga. A Guru takes a disciple into these one by one. In return, the Guru does not accept anything from his disciple. He does it out of kindness and out of a feeling for doing good to his disciple.</p>

<center><img border="0" height="8" src="http://alt.tm.universal-path.org/violin.gif" width="719"></center>

<p>The second thing is, when one practices yoga, then he attains sidhis (supernatural powers). But, these powers are of no use. One who is asking for a price for a mantra, it shows, he did not have anything to give out to anyone else.</p>

<p><strong>Qestioner:</strong> My Lord, it is reported that he (Mahesh) is giving ``Sidhi initiation'' and is charging a minimum of RS 20,000 ($10,000 US approx.) for what he teaches. His Sidhi mantras are Sanskrit verses of the Yoga Sutras and he has promised Sidhis (supernatural powers) as an achievement of the practice. To me it looks like cheating, what is your opinion?</p>

<p><strong>Shankaracharya:</strong> So far as `Yoga Darshan' (the Yoga Sutras of Maharishi Patanjali) is concerned, the first step of the `Yoga Darshan' is `Chitta vritti nirodaha' or control of the fluctuations of the mind. Achievement of Yoga practice is the state of `Samadhi' and `Samadhi' is the goal of the practice. When the Sadhaka (practitioner) reaches the state of `Samadhi' then he may attain some Sidhis like travelling through space, seeing distant objects, etc. But these are obstacles and one should not be attached to these Sidhis, for they do positive disservice to the Sadhakas and their use can cause reversal of spiritual achievement. These Sidhis come of their own accord, naturally to anyone engaged in meditation. But, if the goal is to obtain and use Sidhis then it is a perversion. These are obstacles in the way of samadhi and one should not have any sense of attachment with them, otherwise something undesirable may happen. Any attachment with them is not expected of any yogi.</p>

<p>Who disciplines himself and concentrates (dharana) on `Surya'--``Surya Sanyama Bhubana Jnanam,'' meaning who disciplines or contemplates on Surya, he attains the knowledge of the universe. To get this knowledge one has to concentrate on `Surya.' But, prior to that stage of dharan (one pointed concentration) `pratyahar' is necessary. Pratyahar, realization of Divine Truth in perfect form at all times, is necessary. That stage comes after yama, niyama, asana, and aprnayama. All these stages mean complete discipline of body, mind and emotions with no attachment or aversion of any kind in the world.</p>

<p>Whoever goes in straightaway for meditation for a little while without these preceding stages, cannot get `pratyahar' which is an abstraction of worldly enjoyment and he cannot come to the stage of `dharan' (one pointed concentration). And one who cannot concentrate of discipline himself, how can he attain Sidhis (supernormal powers)? so all these talks are just cheating and an Indian yogi should not do that. This will tarnish India's image.</p>

<p>What Mahesh Yogi need is to show others how to fly. He should fly in the sky in front of everybody. It would be nice if he once flies from America to India without any airplane. Then perhaps what he says can be accepted. Otherwise, he will be like those who entrap people in their net of forgery.''~</p>

<p>A Visit to the Shankaracharya, Part IV</p>
<p>[Editor's Note: The following transcript is taken directly from the taped conversations between Robert Kropinski, a former TM teacher and follower of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and Shree Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, a pre-eminent disciple of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (Guru Dev), who is considered Mahesh Yogi's Spiritual Master.]</p>
<p>Q: My Lord, it is reported by some that with this type of meditation many people have harmed themselves physically and mentally. I think people give huge amounts of money to buy some sickness for themselves?</p>
<p>Shankaracharya: For correct meditation it is necessary to control the emotions of the mind (Chitta). Mind should be free from `raga' and `dweshara' or attachment, likes and aversion, dislikes. So long as mind is not indifferent to outside objects, is not rid of its impurities, free from desires, material objects, etc., wavering mind continues to exist and mind does not stop thinking about them. This process that Mahesh Yogi teaches, there is not place for such a spiritual pursuit. Anyone who comes to him, whether he is a meat-eater, or an alcoholic, he is initiated into dhyaan [TM]. In minds, where attachment and aversion continue to be present, they try to concentrate on outside objects. Because, the process of his yoga is that you sit quietly, let the mind wander wherever it goes, you just repeat the mantra I gave you.</p>
<p>For example, when mother-in-law and daughter-in-law quarrel with each other and after that sit for transcendental meditation (Vabatita) in transcendental meditation center, what will they meditate on? Mother-in-law will meditate on daughter-in-law and vice versa. The reason is simple, both of them are still full of hatred for each other. Without accomplishing the kind of ability needed for meditation, if one meditates, it can be fatal. This is true, however, making the people who are physically very tired, sit peacefully and make them do some yoga posture like shavvasan, etc. can provide temporary peace. But, such a process is not at all helpful in destroying our sins. This (TM) is a worldly Yoga. For people who are distressed by worldly objects, or by worldly problems, they can temporarily forget the world. However, even this much is not achieved if they sit without control over their minds.</p>
<p>One should be qualified for meditation or in other words show them the necessary prerequisites to do meditation.</p>
<p>Who comes to practice this so-called `yoga' (TM), and comes with all anxieties, worries and filled with all worldly thoughts.</p>
<p>Q: [The following paragraph was then read to Shankaracharya from a TM brochure]: Furthermore, there is a specific set of mantras handed down for centuries in the Shankaracharya tradition that seems to have a special property of becoming increasingly pleasing as they are perceived a finer stages. These particular sounds are mantras in Sanskrit. The Shankaracharya tradition has preserved not only these sounds but also a system of rules or formulas by which they are to be assigned to individuals.</p>
<p>And this is what he (Mahesh) is saying in print. These are the mantras he gives to people.</p>
<p>Shankaracharya: He (Mahesh) made them up. These are not given by Guruji (Guru Dev). He (Mahesh) was an ordinary clerk.</p>
<p>People here in India are concerned. He (Mahesh) cheated millions of rupees from people like him (Kropinski). Because of his cheating practices, people might lose faith on Indian Spirituality. Swami Vivekanand and Swami RamTirth left a good impression in America. We wanted that impression to continue. It makes me sad that some people from here like Rajneesh and Mahesh went there (to America) and they destroyed those good feelings. Mahesh has caused a severe blow to Indian culture.</p>
<p>Q: [The following statement was then read to Shankaracharya from a TM brochure. It was explained that this brochure was allegedly spoken by Shankaracharya about Mahesh. Later, Bevan Morris, the President of MIU, read the statement to TM participants by when attempting to raise money from donations.]</p>
<p>He (Mahesh Yogi) comes from the tradition of Shree Shankaracharya. He (Mahesh) is a disciple just like the Master (Guru Dev). He is the bestower of light and is the incarnation of Shankaracharya, the (Mahesh) is the Rishi of the Rishis (Divine Seers), greatest of the great, greater than greatness, he is the reason of the welfare of the tradition of Shankaracharya...</p>
<p>Shankaracharya: Only he can dispel darkness who does not want anything. Only such a person can drive people out of darkness to light. But he himself (Mahesh) is in darkness.</p>
<p>We want that people like you should tell others that he does not know anything about yoga. Neither he is serving American people nor Indian people.~</p>

<p>[Editor's Note: The following transcript is taken directly from the taped conversations between Robert Kropinski, a former TM teacher and follower of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and Shree Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, a pre-eminent disciple of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (Guru Dev), who is considered Mahesh Yogi's Spiritual Master.]</p>
<p>Q: We have heard that Mahesh Yogi instructs mantras himself, and some people believe in him as their teacher. He is a kaaystha (lower caste, not a Brahmin) by birth. Do you think it is appropriate for him to instruct like this?</p>
<p>Shankaracharya: My first information was that he used to place a picture of Guru Dev behind him, that during initiation he would have people worship it and then he would give out mantras. I have met many persons, who, in reality, had their mantras from Mahesh, but they consider themselves to be disciple of Brahmaleen Jagadguru Shankaracharya Brahmanand Saraswati (Guru Dev). But, no matter whom they consider their teacher, the fact of the matter is that a person who gives a mantra is to be considered the real Guru (dispeller of darkness, Spiritual Master). If Mahesh thinks that he is backed by Shankaracharya, then what is proper on his part is to tell people to take initiation from Shankaracharya.</p>
<p>Q: Lord, Mahesh Yogi considers Vishnu Devanand Saraswati as Shankaracharya of the Jyotish peeth. As far as I know he was not consecrated according to Vedic ritual. Also, Mahesh is reported to pay his monthly expenses?</p>
<p>Shankaracharya: I do not have any evidence of his giving money. This, however, is certain, that he, Vishnu Devanand does not have offerings which are enough for his living. Therefore, it seems that he gets income from outside. Moreover, he calls Mahesh Yogi as puujya (revered), as Maharishi (great seer) and stands up on his arrival, these are all things which indicate that he is dependent on him for money. So far as the question of Shankaracharya is concerned, only he is made Shankaracharya who has all the qualities of Mahaanushasan (great discipline). According to Mahaanushasan, Shankaracharya is he who has conquered his senses, knows all the other scriptures. Only such a person, who has all these qualities should sit on the seat of Shankaracharya. In case a wrong person is found to be occupying that seat, he should be dethroned. As far as I know, the scholars from Baneras had held him unable for this seat. Even after that statement, he has not acquired any competency.</p>
<p>Again, the so-called will of the deceased Guru Dev prescribes the name of Dvarikeshanand Saraswati as the second person, not him. It is written in that will (of Guru Dev) that this is clearly my order, that so far as Dvarikeshanand Shastri is alive, there is no one who has the right to make anyone else succeed to that seat unless Dvarkishanand becomes mentally incompetent or else relinquishes the seat himself. Depriving him of his seat is disobedience of the teacher's order. Therefore, neither according to the Mahaanushasan, nor according to the will of Shankaracharya (Guru Dev), is he (Vishnu Devanand) the rightful successor.</p>
<p>When a Sammelan (conference) of all the four seats was called, he (Vishnu Devanand) was not invited there as one presiding over the Jyotish Peeth. Moreover, no other Shankaracharya of any seat allows him to sit next to him.</p>
<p>He knows that in the days ahead he will be exposed. Before that moment arrives, he wants to make sure that he will not have financial difficulty in life. He created on Shankaracharya here. There is Shantinand sitting there (pointing to Shantinand sitting on the stage). They, Shantinand and Vishnu Devanand have no influence on the public. They are raised by Mahesh's money. They just sing his glory.</p>
<p>Q: Mahesh Yogi claims that he preaches yoga according to the instruction of his Guru. The truth of the matter, however, is that Guru Dev never asked anyone who is not a Brahmin by birth to go and spread his teachings. What is your opinion?</p>
<p>Shankaracharya: This is true. In reality, preaching, initiating, guiding people engaged in spiritual pursuits, is the duty of those who are born in a Brahmin family. If he is a follower of Sanatan Dharma (the Hindu religion), he should not do what he is doing. This is against the orders of his Guru. Moreover, making others write puujya (revered), calling himself Maharishi (a great seer) is totally inappropriate. No assembly of saints has either conferred upon him a title of Maharishi nor has announced him puujya.</p>
<p>In the ashram he was doing the work of typing and writing and translation. Then he became a sadhu. However, he has never practiced yoga.</p>
<p>It is said that Guru Dev was given poison. Who gave that poison we don't know but we know that there was poison in his body. When Guru Dev's body became unwell, then we wanted him to go to Kashi to rest. But he (Mahesh) removed him from that trip forcibly and took him to speak in Calcutta. There he died.</p>
<p>After that, this man spread his net. He went abroad. First to Singapore. The expatriate Indians there, thinking that he is the disciple of Shankaracharya, received him well and got him a ticket for the United States. After going to America, he brought the Beatles back here. It was rumored that he did inappropriate things with them and that's why they left him and went away.</p>
<p>He later opened many camps and pretended that he could teach people to read minds and levitate. No one, however, succeeded in learning the things he promised. He himself does not know or practice yoga. He does not know anything about those things. Robert Kropinski, 1985~</p>
<p>( Annotation of the author of this website : The last sentence is an error of Mr. Kropinski : Maharishi is meanwhile far progressed - but with a falsche sign . There is the possibility of developement by "Abisheka" which was used by some masters and is used by black masters to improve the developement of their disciples - which are then bound to them completely !)</p>

<h2>The Pujas of the Shankara order</h2>
<p><b>Panchayatana puja</b> (<i><span class="Unicode" style="white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Pañcāyatana pūjā</span></i>) is a system of worship ('puja') in the Smarta tradition of Hinduism. It consists of the worship of&nbsp; the five deities being Shiva, Vishnu, Devi or Durga, Surya and an Ishta Devata such as Ganesha or Skanda or any personal god of devotee's preference.<sup> </sup>Sometimes the Ishta Devata is the sixth deity in the mandala.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchayatana_puja" target="_blank">Panchayatana puja</a> has been attributed to Adi Shankara, and it is a practice that became popular in medieval India. However, archaeological evidence suggests that this practice long predates the birth of Adi Shankara.</p>

<h2>TM - History after 2000 : Peace palaces, invincibility towers, successorship...</h2>

<p>In 2002, Maharishi asked his German followers to <a href="http://www.agpf.de/TM-Weltregierung.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accuse</a> the german federal government because of the bad health policy, but the lawsuits were rejected because they were formulated too broadly.(see: <a href="http://www.agpf.de/TM-Strafanzeigen2000.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prosecutions</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentmore_Towers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Towers of Mentmore</a>)</p>

<h2>Peace palaces and Maharishi-Sthapatya-Veda®</h2>

<p>In <strong>2002</strong> Maharishi proposed the establishment of so-called "<a href="http://www.vastu-vidya.org/de/index.php?page=PEACE_PALACES&amp;f=1&amp;i=PEACE_PALACES" rel="noopener" target="_blank">peace palaces</a>" with a vedic Vastu architecture. [<a href="http://www.agpf.de/TM-Friedenspalast.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Peace palaces</a>(de); TM <a href="http://www.agpf.de/TM-Immobilien.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Real Estate</a> (AGPF); Friedenspalst Hannover: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W55Ftpe82Qg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Interview </a>....]</p>

<p>His <a href="http://www.artoflife.de/tm-duesseldorf/sthapaty.htm" target="_blank">Maharishi-Sthapatya-Veda</a>® defined a <a href="http://www.sthapatya-veda.de/introduction/frameset.html" target="_blank">Vedic architecture</a> in accordance with the 'Maharishi <a href="?SCI/Natural-law">nature law</a>'.</p>

<p>His concept of a "<a href="http://vediccity.in/overview.asp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vedic City</a>" was specifically implemented in India and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_Vedic_City,_Iowa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">USA in Iowa</a> from 1991. The construction of the city should reflect the TM-Nature-Law and thus the construction of the universe ...</p>

<h2>Sponsors</h2>

<p><strong>2004</strong> Maharishi&nbsp; <a href="https://tmfree.blogspot.com/2008/04/earl-kaplans-letter.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">looses his</a> most important and <a href="http://sarva-darshana.de/Lehrer/abschied.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disappointed</a> longtime worth millions financial sponsor <a href="http://www.agpf.de/TM+EarlKaplan.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earl Kaplan</a>, who named him a liar, deceiver and brainwasher.</p>

<p>Currently, the actor David Lynch with his <a href="http://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/research.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Davidlynchfoundation</a> is a well-known donor collector.</p>

<p>Mr. Lynch opened a 'Foundation for Conscious-Oriented Education and World Peace'.</p>

<p>This for Mr. Lynch <a href="http://www.wildmind.org/blogs/news/flying-yogis-and-flying-millions" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">unpleasant presentation</a> (Flying yogis and ﬂying millions) has evtl. a bit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq0rsiw6IFo&amp;feature=player_embedded" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">truth content...</a>).</p>

<p>In an interview with the 'Wiener Zeitung', Mr. Lynch stated in 2005: 'We are still collecting. I have founded a foundation called the "David Lynch Foundation for Concentration Based Education and Worldpeace". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_University_of_Management#Consciousness-Based_education" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Consciousness-oriented education</a> and world peace go hand in hand. We are striving for a training based on a unified field. The unified field was discovered by quantum physicists only 25 years ago, but it is long known in the Vedic science. It is called "Atma", which means "self" or "soul". It is the power station - all matter and all spirit come out of this field. You wish you could touch it, so super friendly it is. Maharishi Mahesh Yogis Gift to the world is the mental technique that opens the door to this field. (P.S. This field, of course, was not discovered in quantum physics - loud advertising for TM)</p>

<h4>Invincibilty</h4>

<p><strong>2005</strong>&nbsp; the high scools for wurden die <a href="http://www.agpf.de/TM-Oebisfelde.htm" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">Maharishi Hochschulen</a> für 'Invincible defense' in Genf und <a href="http://www.agpf.de/TM-Oebisfelde.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hannover</a> were dedicatet.</p>

<div>
<p>At the Guru Purnima, July 29, 2007, the first almost 14-meter-high 'invincibility tower' was built on a hill between the two meditation halls of the 'Maharishi University of Management' (Fairfield, Iowa) , USA, and inaugurated of 500 Indian pandits at the end of an invincibility course.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><a href="http://www.invincibilitytrusts.org/advisors/hartmann.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Eike Hartmann</a>, TM Minister for Architecture of the Global Land of World Peace, had designed it.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>A little later, Dr. Benjamin Feldman, Finance Minister of the Global Land of World Peace, presented a list of the names of more than 50 countries, in which the foundations for the invincibility towers are laid at the Guru Purnima Day, in Germany, among others. in Erfurt (and <a href="http://www.erfurt.unbesiegbarkeitsschule.de/schulen.php" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other invincibility schools</a>).</p>
</div>

<h4>New Prices</h4>

<div>
<p>Further details on&nbsp; the drastic increased prices since 2002 and the conversion of the initiators to a licensing system can be found at <a href="http://www.tm.org/course-fee" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tm.org</a>, who try to present thehmselfes as a nonprifit organisation.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_Vedic_Approach_to_Health" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Maharishi Ayurveda-Shops</a> pay licenses comparable with a Franchise-System.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Prices(<a href="http://www.alexandra-kopatzki.de/5.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> 2011</a>) were from&nbsp; 500 Euro pro Person upwards with special conditions for students u.a..</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Seminars, Fertilizers and Siddhi-Techniques make <a href="https://www.alternet.org/economy/transcendental-meditation-how-i-paid-2500-password-inner-peace" rel="noopener" target="_blank">further big costs</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Aspiration</h2>

<p><span>Which </span><span>contemporary</span> <span>feels comfortable in ths organisation can be guessed.</span> <span>I have only touched the backgrounds here, and&nbsp; idissociate myself from so-called scientific proofs without a proven reference to spirituality.</span><br>Prerequisite for true spirituality is introspection (Svadhyaya) of any kind. The Ashtanga yoga, which has often been wrongly referenced by members of the movement since 1977, has the same prerequisites in Yama and Niyama - otherwise the 'black path' will be waving.</p>

<p>However, Pantanjali warns against the Siddhis in the Yogasutras and, in contrast to some representations of the movement, does not give any guidance. The summation of Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi can only be implemented by a highly developed Yogi with Samadhi and not by a highly-interpreted coherence and alpha-waves.</p>

<div>
<p>Maharishi, instead, recommends the effect of the ananda of meditation. Did the other gurus just want to make the disciples small ...?!&nbsp; Maharishi himself is also a example for that--.. or?</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Transcendence is not only a "state of restful alertness" (alpha-waves; Maharishi 5 FEBRUARY 2008), possibly accompanied by coherence patterns, however deep this may be.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Therefore the Samadhi teaching with specific Alphawellen, "recognized" by some meditators there, is another sad example of an attempt to "explain" the spirituality in a modern way and gain further influence and money.</p>
</div>

<div><a href="/?Licenses"><img alt="" class="photo" height="171" longdesc="/?Licenses" src="./userfiles/images/320px-Maharishi_5_jan_2008.JPG" style="float: right; margin: 5px;" title="Maharishi 5. FEBRUAR 2008" width="179"></a>

<p>.....................................................................................................</p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, I can only disapprove of the spirit that prevails in the movement, which also has something to do with the fact, that the Yama and the Niyama of the propagated Pantanjali Yoga are not put into practice here.</p>

<p>Only the fact that so many souls do not sink into the darkness after death is positive from my point of view.</p>

<p>Spirituality can not become a spiritual materialism - that would be a variant of the black tantric path.</p>

<h4>Vlodrop</h4>

<p>In 1983 Maharishi moved from the Swiss Seelisberg to the Netherlands and bought the former monastery of St. Ludwig near Vlodrop directly at the German border. In 1967 he had visited Amsterdam for the first time.</p>

<p>Meru-mvu, founded there, is located near Roermond on the German border. After 2000 Vlodrop was his mean seat. But besides he dwelled often in Fairfield (Iowa).</p>

<h2>MUM - Maharishi University of Managemnent</h2>

<p>Another blinding step was the founding of a <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5rcNTly3Q" rel="noopener" target="_blank">university for management</a> (MUM), which still exists today in a modified form in Iowa.</p>

<h2>Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Vedic Vishwavidyalaya (MMYVV)&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<p>In 1980, Maharishi returned from <a href="http://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/schweizer-geschichte/die-fliegenden-yogis-von-seelisberg-1.18473566" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Seelisberg</a> to India and established the <a href="http://www.maharishiinstituteofmanagement.com/mnagar-camp.jsp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Maharishi Nagar</a> (<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi_Vedic_University" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MMYVV</a>) as the Indian center of the movement near New Delhi<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Other centers were created in <a href="http://www.mum.edu/about/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fairfield (Iowa 52557,USA)</a> and in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MERU,_Holland" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Netherlands</a>(MERU - Vlodrop).</p>

<p>In India (<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi_Vedic_University" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MMYVV</a>)&nbsp; is a ground for such mass movements, especially when it is connected with livelihood and jobs. [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twZRwVOmDxY" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Video of 2011 !</a>]</p>

<h2>Worldgovernment of the age of enlightenment</h2>

<p>After all, Maharishi opened the long-planned "World Government of the Age of Enlightenment" - with ministers and governors and Rajas - in my opinion a chicanery of the followers because&nbsp; he had to be clear about the outcome.</p>

<p>The large room of a hotel in Seelisberg in Switzerland was <a href="https://www.srf.ch/play/tv/popupvideoplayer?id=09592ec1-7591-4451-8207-006715cca5ae&amp;startTime=113.742" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">painted golden</a>, the male initiators had to dress themselves in blue, the female initiators had to dress themselves red and sit apart.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="photo" src="./userfiles/images/tmworld.jpg" style="width: 288px; height: 205px; float: right; padding: 1px; border: 1px solid rgb(2, 26, 64); border-radius: 3px; margin: 5px;" title="Worldplan..."> The former german initiator Therese Schulte has reported extensively in her book ("Transzendentale Meditation und wohin sie führt -Transcendental Meditation and where it leads", which unfortunately is out of print, but both in my posession).</p>

<p><span>In the magazine "Worldgovernment" No. 3 of 1978 on page 30 Maharishi's new world order is described.</span></p>

<p>In 1983 appeard in the german STERN(R) magazine and also international a full-page advertisement in which the 'World Government of the Age of Enlightenment' invited all governments to solve their problems. The payment needed first take place after the achievement, etc .. In the process one relied even boldly on Guru Dev Brahmananda Sarasvati.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>In the article in the 'Stern', Maharishi refered to Guru Dev Brahmananda Saraswati, although Maharishi was expressly not requested by Guru Dev as successor, and was not, of course, entrusted with his mission.<br>I can not publish the ridiculously freaked full-page article of the Stern magazine, which still provides much more, unfortunately for copyright.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twZRwVOmDxY" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Film of 2011 !</a>]</p>

<p>Maharishi had surrounded himself with a group of about 100 disciples, all of whom had private income. In the distribution of the ministerial posts of the world government had the Sanskrit scholar Vernon Kaz, the Brahmachari Nandikishore, and Versey Crichton the right to be address with 'their honor'. The 10 areas of responsibility&nbsp; of the Ministers were:</p>

<p>1. Development of consciousness<br>2. Natural law and order<br>3. Cultural Integrity, <a href="?Current-Issues/Invincibility">Invincibility</a> and worldharmony<br>4. Education and enlightenment<br>5. Solemnity and fulfillment<br>6. Prosperity and progress<br>7. Information and inspiration<br>8. Research and Development<br>9. Capital cities of the age of enlightenment<br>10. Health and immortality</p>

<p>So-called governors were to support these ministers: 'For the administration of the age of enlightenment, teachers and governors of the era of enlightenment should be trained. A governor will be someone who has the natural ability to fulfill his desires' (Maharishi)</p>

<p>In addition, there were course coordinators, national leaders (as currently in Germany Mr. Schiffgens) and trustees. Thus, a network of bureaucracy was formed over the meditator. The lessons were recorded on video, and Maharishi was barely reachable for average meditators.</p>
&nbsp;

<div class="mui-panel">
<h2>== Summary of the content ==</h2>

<p>The world government of the age of enlightenment enjoys sovereignty in the domain of consciousness and authority in the invincible power of natural law ...<br><br>The unified field of all natural laws has been outlined by the theory of supergravation in quantum physics, and, as Maharishi recently brought to light, this is completely contained in the ancient Vedic literature (this led to the foundation of Maharishi's "Vedic University." But his teaching stands in contrary to the Indian tradition and the tradition of Shankara etc..(Neo Hinduism)<br><br>The application of this knowledge had led to Maharishi's system of education, health, administration, defense and rehabilitation.</p>

<p><span>'The invitation of the World Government to all governments' was based on this knowledge</span><span>(Note: partnership!)&nbsp; to ascend to&nbsp; a </span><span>new level of "problem-free governing".</span><br><br>The individual will enjoy a life free of problems and suffering, and the whole human family&nbsp; will enjoy lasting world peace - the age of 10,000 years of enlightenment.</p>

<h2>Invincibility</h2>

<p>The word "<strong>Siddhi</strong>" means "perfection" and "higher powers" in Sanskrit, so that according to TM-Advertising with the TM-Sidhi program a mastery, that is unknown in the normal waking consciousness, can be obtained over the <a href="?SCI-Pseudoscience/Natural-law">natural laws</a>, and so the individual at the same time can live in an ever more intensive harmony with the laws of nature in his own thinking and action.</p>

<div style="float:right;&quot;"><a href="/tm/Unbesiegbarkeitsturm"><img alt="" class="photo" longdesc="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MUM_campus_and_tower_.JPG" src="http://tm-aufkl%C3%A4rung.de/data/_uploaded/image/MUM_campus_and_tower_.JPG" style="float: right; width: 227px; height: 168px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"></a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Invincibility tower in Fairfield</div>

<p>One of the main themes within the TM-Siddhi-Program&nbsp; propagated by Maharishi was the so-called <strong>invincibility</strong> associated with his 'concept' of the <a href="?Current-Issues/Global-Country" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank" trel="noopener"> 'global country of worldpeace'</a> on the basis of so-called 'invincible nations' with the support of an <a href="http://www.invincibledefense.org/technology.html" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">'invincible defense group'</a> on the basis of yogic allegedly coherent&nbsp; <a href="http://tm-aufkl%C3%A4rung.de/tm/Pseudofliegen">TM-Flyers</a>'(better: foamy poppies - see below) in the so-called ''<a href="http://www.meditation.at/Meditation2/kurzinfo.htm" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">uniform field</a>''.</p>

<p>Invincibility as direct technological application of the most advanced discoveries (like in adventure games ?) in the fields of quantum mechanics, neuroscience, and human consciousness.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>1999 </strong></span>Maharishi announced "The Year of Invincibility to Every Nation".</p>

<p><strong>2008</strong> In this context, Maharishi founded the <a href="http://press-conference.globalgoodnews.com/archive/january/08.01.11.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brahmanand Saraswati Trust</a> on 11 January 2008 shortly before his death, "to secure the invincibility for the whole of mankind over time by supporting the groups of Vedic TM pundits in the world capital of Raam Raj Brahma-Sthan (center of India) on the 48 Brahmanand Saraswati Nagar (road), and in all Maharishi towers of invincibility around the world. But this did not mean that Maharishi invested a large part of his huge assets or later inherited.</p>

<p>Maharishi designed the <a href="http://press-conference.globalgoodnews.com/archive/january/08.01.11.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">invincible structure of the enlightened leadership</a> of the Global Council of the Brahmanand Saraswati Trusts, now and for all future generations. The patron of trust would always be His Holiness "Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math" who had (supposedly) accepted to take this great position".</p>

<hr size="1">
<p>His successor, Maharaja Adhiraj Rajaraam, bourgeois, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Nader" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tony Nader</a>, a Lebanese neurophysiology professor, had been crowned 2000 by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as the 'First Regent of the Global Land of World Peace' and awarded the honorary title 'Nader Raam'.</p>

<p>To the continuance of Maharishi's teachings, he announced the construction of 48 'Towers of Invincibility' in 48 countries. [-&gt; <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi#cite_note-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wiki of 31.5.2017</a>]</p>

<h2>VEDA ala Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</h2>

<div>
<p>After the world government flop and the negative judgment of the german federal Administrative Court and two negative after-judgments, Maharishi turned to the Veda, to whose writings he then wrote numerous wilful comments, which Shankara had replaced with the Advaita Vedanta, which has various other contents.</p>

<p>The Vedas were presented as a source of all knowledge.</p>

<hr size="1">
<p>At the beginning of his career, Maharishi offered an 'explanation' of Western physics about the indian elements (Vayu, etc.). From an 'Anu' of the Samkhya was nothing heard from the alleged physicist with conclusion 1942 in Allahabad.</p>

<p>Further explanations were later given in his '<a href="/SCI-Pseudoscience">Science of Creative Intelligence</a>', which was presented in paid video courses. <span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>The summit was a so-called 'uniform field' with an ominous '<a href="?SCI-Pseudoscience/Natural-law">natural law</a>' behind all the phenomena that was propagated as the basis of the Vedas.</span></span></p>

<div style="float:right"><img alt="" class="photo wborder" height="221" longdesc="&lt;tm/Maharishi_European_Research" src="./userfiles/images/Maharishi_European_Research_University.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 5px;" width="153"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Open research </em></div>

<div style="float:right">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="float:right">&nbsp;</div>

<p>SCI was supposed to be a systematic study of the unified structure of the 'natural law' based on creation, in which the unified field theories of modern quantum physics are brought to light. SCI was said to the study of universal principles. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quantum field theory</a> is probably not well known. Modern science has turned towards the Higgs-Field, which is similar to hinduist Maya.</p>

<p>The Bhagavad Gita, the Brahma Sutras, the Karma Mimamsa Sutras, the Nyaya Sutras, the Vaisheshika Sutras, the Samkhya Sutras, and the Ramayana had to accept peculiar comments.</p>

<p>Quantum physics can not formulate it, since the Shabda and the Chit are far beyond physics. Our world ultimately consists of Maya - energies set into vibration by the light of the Atman. The mental Prakriti as a higher nature is also already beyond our matter. It is also subject to the Purusha as an individualized Atman.</p>

<p>In his <a href="?Current-Issues/MUM">Maharishi University of Management</a> the student could then study a so-called 'Vedic science'. There were also management courses available.<br><br>Crowned scientist such as Mr. Hagelin and Mr. Nader do not make the explanations more true.</p>

<h2>Maharishi - Ayurveda</h2>

<figure style="float:right;"><img alt="" class="photo wborder" src="./userfiles/images/320px-Fairfield_Business_Park,_Fairfield_IA.JPG" style="margin: 5px; float: right; width: 250px; height: 200px;">
<figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Maharishi Ayurveda Fairfiled</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After the <a href="?Current-Issues/Worldgovernment">world government</a> flop and the negative judgment of the german Federal Administrative Court and two further negative after-judgments Maharishi turned to the <a href="?Veda">Veda</a>, to whose scriptures he then wrote numerous comments, which Shankara, however, had replaced with the Advaita Vedanta, which has various other contents.</p>

<p>At that time was an Ayurveda boom, and Maharishi used the wellness wave to spread his world-resolving fantasies.</p>

<p>The health system of the Ayur-Veda became a financially strong focus after start-up problems and gave work to Indians, and the TM meditation was integrated into it.</p>

<p>In 1993, the professor of medicine, Dr. Dieter von Schmädel, from Regensburg, Germany, stated that '<a href="http://www.fairfieldinfocenter.org/fairfield-tm-information-center/ayurveda/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Maharishi Ayurveda</a>' is ultimately only a method of "bringing the techniques of TM and self-developed medicines to the woman or man" with the help of Ayurveda.</p>

<h2>Kompetence problems</h2>

<p>However, there were at first a number of serious problems of competence and scandals in practice, caused by&nbsp; personal interpretations of Maharishis ramblings, until one had severely pegged off in India. (The downloadable <a href="http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/puran.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scriptures</a> in the USA-TM are mostly written in Sanskrit ...)</p>

<p>Several doctors in London lost their accreditation after applying their <a href="?Veda/Ayurveda/Deadly-Treatments">own and deadly receipture</a>.</p>

<p>Todays treatments <span> are much more expert, but even the immune system stimulating herbal pills are not an invention of movement. </span>In germany, austria and switzerland exists 8 ayurvedic centers.</p>

<p>The meanwhile self-employed indian <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_Chopra" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deepak Chopra</a> then entered the controversial scene in the USA.</p>

<h2>Ayurveda</h2>

<p>The ajurvedic health system is based, among other things, on the Tridosha doctrine of the Yajur-Veda, one of four (five) Indian Vedas (Rig, Sama, Atharva, White Yajur and Black Yajur Veda).</p>

<p>Ayurveda does not only include healing, but also health-promoting diets, the latter also as preventive medicine, as far as possible with such simple means. <img alt="" src="./userfiles/images/Godofayurveda.jpg" style="float: right; width: 129px; height: 223px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"></p>

<p>Actually, Ayurveda also means the worship of the divinity Dhanvantari with mantras like 'Om Shree Donvontrey namaha', which are replaced here by the <a href="?TM-Meditation/TM-Mantras">TM mantras</a>.</p>

<p>According to the ancient ayurvedic scholar 'Charaka', 'Ayur' consists of four essential parts, that is, the combination of body, mind, senses and soul.</p>

<p>The treatment in Ayurveda consists of Anna, Ahara (diet), Vihara (daily routine), and Aushadha (medicine) together or separately, prescribed according to the patient's illness and condition. The various methods of treatment provide both preventive and healing forms of therapy. There are also meditation exercises and marma-massages of points of the body.</p>

<h2>Doshas</h2>

<p>The Vedas were created as a later heritage of the Aryans who immigrated to India, on which also the degenerate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manusmriti" rel="noopener" target="_blank">system of the Manu</a> is based. They were replaced by Adi Shankara's Advaita sampradaya doctrine and by tantric teachings.</p>

<p>The three ajurvedic basic principles of Vata, Pitta and Kapha are derived from the five elements of ether (akasha), fire, air, water and earth, which also occur in Shankara's teachings. They recall the 3 Gunas of the Prakriti of the Bhagavad-Gita (Sattwa - Rajas - Tamas).</p>

</div>

<div>
<p>But the Ayurveda and the Doshas are not spiritual: Sri Krishna says in the Gita: "Be without the 3 Gunas, o Arjuna".</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>The medical therapies of the Ajurveda are so simple that they are not paid by the german health insurance funds or only on request (court judgments), despite over a hundred so-called "scientific" measurements by the sect.</p>

<p>An alternative to Ayurveda would be very specific receipes of natural medicine or a diets after the four blood types (such as in "Dr. P. J. D'Adamo: 4 Blood Types" section) or the Chinese medicine combined with qigong exercises, breathing exercises and massages. The tibetan medicine integrated Ayurveda centuries ago.</p>

<p>The sale of Indian herbs at an exchange rate of more than 50 Indian Rupees to one Euro should be worthwhile, especially if a company name of Maharishi was printed there(Franchise like system).</p>

<h2>Therapies</h2>

<p>For example, the eye is treated with a clay ring around the eye, into which sesame oil is poured, etc. <span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>Inunctions and massages with sesame oil are an integral part of this teaching </span></span>- as well as Indian herbs (many persons have therefore a oil-shining forehead).</p>

<p>For the western countries the degree of purity is a problem. Instead of indian plants are often european and american substitutes used, which is another problem. The indian plant extracts used and imported to Germany and other countries are often somewhat dubious and uncertain, and the sale has already had problems (food supplements, toxins).</p>

<p>In the background of the whole stands the TM-Meditation (with appropriate initiation) as "natural simple method". Traditionally, the "OM" meditation was used, or the above Dhanvantari with mantras like '<i>Om Shree Donvontrey nahmaha</i>' and other mantras of this deity.</p>

<p>In the meantime (as far as I know) the ancient Indian "So-Ham" - breathing meditation technique was added.</p>
</div>

<h2>Massages</h2>

<p>An essential part of Ayurveda is&nbsp; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhyanga" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marma massage</a> with oiling. The healing effect of massages is known from Asia, especially from Chinese medicine. However, massages by untrained masseurs can cause health damage!</p>

<h2>Plants</h2>

<p>There are different schools in indian Ayurveda, but whether they work with essences from minerals or on the basis of herbs, without herbs and minerals is Ayurveda&nbsp; relatively ineffective.</p>

<p>Also, one should not confound indian medicinal plants with Ayurveda. Dried plants are not necessarily Ayurveda, even when they are used. They function not only over doubtful Doshas but are also allopatic effective and stimulate possibly the immune system.</p>

<p>Special antibiotic medicinal plants such as the indian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azadirachta_indica" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NEEM</a> tree are available everywhere. In Germany and in the EU, drugs with a high potency can only be sold in pharmacies. The GINKO is a more recent example.</p>

<p>The Chinese medicine (in the TM Movement a hot iron) has experiences in medicine as well as the Tibetans or the South American schamans. Medicinal plants have often strong side effects and can cause cross-resistance to certain antibiotics like in the case of 'tea tree oil'.</p>

<p>The subtle difference with Maharishi is that the plant preparations are to be taken at certain times of the day. Day rhythms, however, are also common practice in Ayurveda. It is well-known that the use of drugs at certain times of the day has a special effect, because it supports certain hormonal distributions.</p>

<p>Taking tea at specific times and rhythms is only a cheap imitation of true Ayurveda, since dried plants do not have the appropriate vital forces (Prana) because of ignorant harvesting and drying. Ayurvedic clinics in Sri Lanka and Kerala also use fresh plants and fresh flowers.</p>

<h2>== Panchakarma ==</h2>

<p><span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>Furthermore</span> <span>the five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchakarma" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PANCHAKARMA</a> cleanings are also the order of the day in Ayurveda. These five procedures allegedly eliminate the spoiled doshas from the body. They are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vamana_%28Panchakarma%29" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vamana</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virechana" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Virechana</a>, Niroohavasti, Nasya(Instilling medicine by the nose), and Anuvasanavasti(oil enema).</span></span></p>

<hr size="1">
<h2>Beefs against the German federal government</h2>

<p>These medical endeavors had a temporary climax when Maharishi asked the german pupils to make beefs against the federal government because of their allegedly bad health policy (I agree with this - this is not only so in germany - but Ayurveda is sure not the solution). The complaints were rejected by the state prosecutors because of the vagueness. For more details see also german&nbsp; <a href="http://www.agpf.de/TM-Strafanzeigen2000.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AGPF</a>.</p>

<p><span>Someone asked for information about Ayurvedic "medicine".</span> <span>Here is an excerpt from something I found on the internet last year.</span> For openers, I recap one instance of the Ayurvedic approach (details below):</p>

<p><span>They treated AIDS patients with plant preparations mixed from plant material, fertilizer, faeces and bacteria ... He then died ....</span></p>

<p>This article discusses an unfortunate encounter between the leading medical pundit of the movement and the American Medical Association, in which he managed to fool the AMA Journal. They finally detected the fraud.</p>

<p><span>I hope you find this information..... enlightening.</span></p>

<p><strong>Skolnick</strong>, Andrew A. "<a href="http://www.aaskolnick.com/mav.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Maharishi Ayur-Veda: Guru's Marketing Scheme</a>"</p>

<p><u>Promises the world eternal perfect health', Journal of the American Medical Association_ 266, no. 13 (October 2, 1991), pages 1741-1750.</u></p>

<p>Skolnick's long article, published in JAMA's "Medical News &amp; Perspectives" section, intensively examines the facts of the case and concludes that [Deepok] Chopra has repeatedly lied about his relationship to "Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International , Inc. " , and all three authors even failed in the correction of August 1991 [published in JAMA] to reveal all their important implications.</p>

<p>Rather, Skolnick found that "Maharishi Ayur-Veda" is not so much a revival of traditional Indian medicine but more "a trademark for a range of products and services."</p>

<p>He wrote :<br>An investigation of the marketing practices of the TM movement reveals what seems to be a widespread pattern of misinformation and deception, and manipulation of the laymens and media of scientific news.</p>

<p>This campaign seems to have the goal of gaining at least the appearance of scientific respectability for the TM movement, as well as making gains from sales of the main products and services that bear Maharishi 's names. <span>Skolnick then documents this&nbsp; in detail.</span></p>

<p>He describes several appalling examples of fraud and quackery, culminating in a report of the professional misdirection of two British para-physicists (Leslie Davis, MA, MD, BCh, FRCS, Dean of Physiology at the "Maharishi University of Natural Law", Bedfordshire, Roger A. Chalmers, MA, MB, BCh, MRCP, Dean of Medicine at the "Maharishi Ayur-Veda College of Natural Medicine" and President of the World Medical Association for Perfect Health, Bedfordshire).</p>

<p>They treated AIDS patients with herbal supplements "made up of plant material, fungus, excrement, and bacteria." An AIDS patient suffering from food problems had caused costs after administering this irritant mixture (as he died afterwards) the matter came before the "Professional Conduct Committee" of the "General Medical Council" in London. It seems that this concatenation of events is responsible for the sudden "interest" in Maharishi's Ayur-Veda.</p>

<h2>The foam rubber hopping (Pseudoflying)</h2>

<p>In 1978, the TM-movement published pictures of flying <a href="http://www.zeit.de/1978/46/das-fuerchten-und-das-fliegen-lernen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">meditators in Lotus-seat</a>.

<p><strong>My further comment:</strong> When i see the hopping meditators thoughts like 'dupery' and "<a href="http://www.icsahome.com/articles/meditation--delusion-and-deception-bardin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">awakenening of false hopes (court!)</a>" go throught my head.</p>

<p>Therefore a hint : You can also meditate in a cable-raleway and then float(its very much cheaper and without disappointment...)...and of couse 'fly' like this :</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:Normal">At first </span></strong>the TM-Sidhi Program&nbsp; of 1976 consisted of<b> </b>sentences from&nbsp; sutras, which were every 15 second mentally repeated&nbsp; after 20 minutes of meditation.

<p>Soon after that followed a false flying-techniqe ( <a href="?Yogic-pseudo-flying">foam rubber levitation</a> ) with the illusionary expectation of a sudden uplifting in the air - of course with an relative expensive initiation on special courses - and with 3 steps of 'development'(as an excuse)....</p>

<p>Also other magic-occult abilities were in the discussion. Maharishi : 'There is nothing a meditator cannot do because he is opened for infinity.</p>

<p>Maharishi then related to&nbsp; Patanjali. But Patanjali warns in his Yogasutras that such binding forces&nbsp; hinder true progress.</p>

<pre>The TM-Sidhi program is nothing other than a set of sutras (words or
phrases), mentally repeated every fifteen seconds after doing a twenty
minute session of TM.  Each sutra is mentally repeated twice (if time allows 4
times) - a 15 second pause in between each repetition.

The sutras used in the TM-Sidhi program are:
Friendliness
Compassion
Happiness
Strength of an elephant
Bronchial tube
Inner light
Sun
Moon
Polestar
Trachea
Navel
Distinction between intellect and transcendence
Transcendence intition
Transcendence finest hearing

</ul>

<p>Mahesh Yogi, Maharishi (2001). <i>Ideal India: the lighthouse of peace on earth</i>. Maharishi University of Management Press. S.&nbsp;308. ISBN 978-90-806005-1-5 :</p>

<p>....Yogic Flying is a phenomena [<i>sic</i>] created by a specific thought projected from Transcendental Consciousness, the Unified Field of Natural Law, the field of all possibilities. This is the simplest state of human consciousness, self-referral consciousness, which is easily accessible to anyone through Transcendental Meditation, and is enlivened through the TM Sidhi Programme, which leads to Yogic Flying.....</p>

<p>This techniqe became known as ' <span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span title="">Relationship of body and Akasha - lightness like cotton fiber</span></span> '( its just that akashi is not light but empty)</p>

<p>* An example from the 9. mandala of the <a href="http://spiritwiki.de/Rigveda" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rig-Veda</a> :</p>

<pre>The much touted *levitation* or yogic flying technique is a sutra repeated
in the same way as other sutras:
RELATIONSHIP OF BODY AND AKASHA - LIGHTNESS OF COTTON FIBER.

After doing the flying sutra for 5-30 minutes, the instruction is to rest
for 10-30 minutes and then read the Hindu Scriptures for -10 minutes.

An example of the readings (from the Ninth Mandala of Rig Veda)
"Flow Soma, in a most sweet and exhilarating stream, effused for Indra to
drink.  The all-beholding destroyer of Rakshasas has stepped upon his
gold-smitten birthplace, united with the wooden cast.  Be the lavish giver
of wealth,  most bounteous, the destroyer of enemies; bestow on us the
riches of the affluent.  Come with food to the sacrifice of the mighty
gods, and bring us strength and sustenance.  To thee we come,  O dropping
Soma;  for thee only is this our worship day  by day, our prayers are to
thee, none other."</pre>

<p><cite>Meanwhile these sutras have been updated with others from the vedas.</cite></p>

<p>From the introduction, pages 701-704: <strong>The basic element in the TM-Sidhis is the experience of "samyama"</strong> . . . a spontaneous mental process that begins to take place once pure consciousnes, or "samadhi," is established to a sufficient degree of stability to coexist with mental activity.....</p>

<p><strong>Kommentar </strong>: Here the TM-Meditation is uplifted to an illusionary&nbsp; samadhi,&nbsp; because samadhi is a foundation for</p>

<p>Samyama&nbsp; and levitation - siddhis. The fertilizers with the long mantrams are a prereqisitory for the siddhi&nbsp; techniqs,</p>

<p>and so people have a motivation to take the costly fertilizer - initiations - which brings continuous money to the initiators</p>

<p>and the organization...</p>

<p>* But Maharishi did not allow personal brain current measurement nor did he levitate himself.</p>

<h2>Science of creative Intelligence</h2>
</div>

<div>
<p>In <strong>1961</strong>, the Maharishi created the "International Meditation Society for the Science of Creative Intelligence".</p>

<p>In <strong>1971</strong> the Maharishi inaugurated "Maharishi's Year of Science of Creative Intelligence" and described SCI as the connection of "modern science with ancient Vedic science". But the contents are sobering.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his career, Maharishi offered an 'explanation' of western physics about the indian elements (Vayu, etc.). From an Anu of the Samkhya had the alleged physicist with conclusion 1942 in Allahabad probably heared nothing before.</p>

<div style="float:right"><img alt="Author Mediawiki Author 	Roland Zumbühl - CC3 - Lizenz" class="photo" height="235" id="Urheber Roland Zumbühl, CC3 Lizenz" longdesc="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maharishi_European_Research_University.jpg" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Maharishi_European_Research_University.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 5px;" width="159"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Open research hotel<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; in&nbsp; Switzerland</em></div>

<p>The further explanations happend within his '<a href="http://www.maharishischooliowa.org/academics/science-of-creative-intelligence/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Science of creative Intelligence </em></a>which was distributed in video courses. <span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>The summit was a so-called 'unified field' with an ominous 'natural law' behind all phenomena which was propagated as the basis of the Vedas.</span></span></p>

<p>SCI was propagated as a systematic study of the unified structure of 'Natural Law' on the basis of creation, bringing to light the unified field theories of modern <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Quantenphysik" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quantum physics</a>. SCI involves the study of universal principles. They probably do not know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quantum field theory</a>...</p>

<p>The Bhagavad-Gita, the Brahma-Sutras, the Karma Mimamsa-Sutras, the Nyaya-Sutras, the Vaisheshika-Sutras, the Samkhya-Sutras and the Ramayana had to take peculiar comments.</p>

<p>Quantum physics can not formulate it because the Shabda and the Chit are far beyond physics. Our world is ultimately made up of through the influence of the Atman vibrating Maya energies. The mental Prakriti as higher nature is also already beyond our matter. It is also subject to the Purusha as an individualized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Atman</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="./userfiles/images/perl.jpg" style="width: 10px; height: 10px;"> The TM - Natural law</p>

<p>According to Maharishi, the Veda is the basis for the countless natural laws, of which today's science knows only a sub-range. Maharishi propagated a unified field of all natural laws, which at the same time was the potential of all natural laws. To this there was according to his sight a western scientific and an eastern meditative approach. The Vedas, the Samkhya and the Bhagavad Gita had to serve as a scientific background. He who comes to the source of thought, attains certain faculties and is able to determine his fate within the natural laws.</p>

<p>There is, however, de facto no western scientific access to such high planes, and there will never be any. There is also no alleged <a href="?SCI-Pseudoscience/Coherence">coherence</a>.</p>

<p><span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>In his commentary on the Brahma Sutras (III, 2, 38, and 41), Adi Shankara spoke of the Ishvara, who administers the karma - law <span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>and therefore everyone is subject to him.</span></span> </span></span></p>

<p>Furthermore, a quotation from Sri Aurobindo: 'The so-called absolute laws of nature are only a balance established by nature, a groove in which nature is accustomed to work to achieve certain results. But when you change consciousness, the groove will inevitably change.' (A.B. Purani, <a href="http://www.transformationundatem.de/kapitel-2-1-seite16.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Evening Talks, S. </em>92</a>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>TM - Coherence</h2>

<p>Coherence (lat. Cohaerere, cohere) is an essential point of view in psychology and psychiatry, under which the formal thought processes of patients are judged (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_disorder" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mental disorder</a>).<br><br>Here, coherence means that the train of thought - apart from the subjects and facts formulated in terms of content - is in itself logical, coherent, and comprehensible.</p>

<h2>Neurology</h2>

<p>Coherence of brain waves (in reality, scalp currents are measured - the brain itself could only be observed roughly over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tomography</a> with contrast media, more recently also by laser technology) is a modern topic in neurology.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In humans as well as in many animals there is a sense, a neurobiologically central sensibility for constructive (coherent connection, inside or eg also in the social systems) innate. <span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>Our brain follows the organizational principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference" rel="noopener" target="_blank">self-referentiality</a>.</span></span></p>

<h2>Inner Medicine</h2>

<p>In medicine there is coherence for optimal synchronization of the rhythms of heart beat, respiration and blood pressure (cardiac coherence).<i></i></p>

<h2><i>Physic</i></h2>

<p>In physics, coherence means frequency- and phase-equivalent waves, for example laser light waves, or quantum mechanical states.</p>

<h2>Signalanalysis</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(signal_processing)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">signal processing</a> coherence is the absolute square of the normalized mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density#Cross-spectral_density" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cross-power spectrum</a>.</p>

<h2><i>Linguistics</i></h2>

<p>In the narrower sense the semantic context of the words in a text; in a wider sense, the term coherence also encompasses the syntactic relationships between sentences, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_(linguistics)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anaphor</a>, cataphor.</p>

<h2><strong>The TM-Coherence</strong></h2>

<p>If the TM-movement shows an increased coherence of scalping currents (!) during the <a href="?Yogic-pseudo-flying">pseudo-flying</a>, I think it is a <a href="?SCI-Pseudoscience/Crackpot-Science">bluff</a> because the body is not relaxed during the hopping movement. The measurements of such currents were never proven and made by members of the movement, just like real flying was never&nbsp; never shown - in TM - films it suddenly goes.</p>

<p>The electrodes would have to be glued or a special helmet put on (which happens nowadays). Paper is patient and can not resist, and what is to be held by statements of interest representatives and profiteers is .....</p>

<p>Apart from that, coherent currents occur in all areas of life and in much greater magnitude without affecting the environment.</p>

<h2>Consciousness and TM-Coherence</h2>

<p>Consciousness is a controversial term. The Vedanta distinguishes four states of consciousness: Vaishvanara, the waking state, Taijasa, the dream state, Prajñā and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turiya" target="_blank">Turiya</a> (the fourth).<br>The average meditator first experiences the chitta of the mental plane. Only the Shabda of the true Samadhi contains a state of nondual consciousness.&nbsp; The average meditator first experiences the <em>chitta</em> of the mental plane. Only the Shabda of the true Samadhi contains a state of nondual consciousness.</p>

<p>Maharishi then propagated seven states of consciousness (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScwYJ7GHixw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Video 1</a> ; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YthYUKr8Uus">Video 2</a>&nbsp; -&gt; there are also parts 3 to 5 of the video) up to a cosmic consciousness and then to a consciousness of God(which corresponds to the Ishvara consciousness of step 19 of the <a href="http://universal-path.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">universal path)</a>, but its masters are different are structured than Maharishi, and which, in my opinion, he does not have. After this comes a unity consciousness (for this: <a href="https://www.mum.edu/assets/pdf_resources/mvs_principles.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Principles of MVS</a>).</p>

<p>The Mandukya Upanishade deals with them in detail. The four states of consciousness (Avastha), which are also described in Shivaism, are also called Jagrat, Svapna, Sushupti and Turiya. In the Yogasystems also further stages (Bhumikas) are described.</p>

<p>Certainly, coherence does not mean a Samadhi (as a so-called misinterpreted fast fourth TM - consciousness - state) or Turiya, which is in combination with concentration (dharana) and meditation (dhyana) as Samyama&nbsp; the prerequisite for propagated <strong>Siddhis</strong> like <a href="?Yogic-pseudo-flying">foam-rubber flying</a>.</p>

<p>Patanjali warns before the binding and hindering effects of such forces. Only a very advanced yogi is at all capable of doing so. A uplifted coherence with alpha waves as sign of deep relaxation can definitely not bring such states.<br><br>In the meantime severeal neurologist measured that gamma waves are more relevant, which occur not only in Vipassana but also in lucid dreaming and less during TM-meditation.</p>

<hr size="1">
<h4>Patanjali and the Yogasutras</h4>

<p>Patanjalis Ashtanga yoga is a step-by-step process that had long before been described in the Sandilya Upanishade of Atharvaveda.</p>

<p>This eightfold path is also explained in Yoga Yajnavalkya, in several Upanishads and in other writings such as Devi Bhagavatam 7.35, Sivasamhita and Hathapradipika.</p>

<p>Today's Shankara Order also represents the steps of Ashtanga Yoga and does not dispense with the first three steps: "Ashtanga Yoga--Yama, niyam, aasan, praanayaam, pratyaahaar, dhaarnaa, dhyaan, samaadhi.</p>

<p>These are the eight limbs of yoga. A guru takes a student one by one through them. For this, the Guru takes nothing from his disciple. He does it out of kindness and from the feeling of doing something good for his student."&nbsp; Shree Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati (The Illustrated Weekly of India, September 13, 1987)</p>

<h4>From dhyana to samyama</h4>

<p>Patanjali writes&nbsp; in the Yogasutras III (On the Supernatural Forces: Vibhuti Pada ) :</p>

<p>4 These three (dharana, dhyana, samadhi) are collectively referred to as "collection" (samyama).</p>

<p>5 Their mastery leads to view of wisdom.</p>

<p>6 It is applied to the different areas.</p>

<p>7 These three (dharana, dhyana, samadhi) are the inner core of the earlier aspects of Yoga (ie. yama, niyama, asana, pranayama and pratyahara)......</p>

<h4>D The world of yogic reality</h4>

<p>19 Applying the "collection" (samyama) to experience, one gets knowledge of the thoughts of others.<br>20 Nicht aber (erlangt man Wissen von) der Grundlage dieser (Gedanken), da sie nicht zum Objekt werden kann.<br>21 But not&nbsp; the basis of this, since it can not become an object.</p>

<p>22 Applying the "collection" to the appearance of the body, the power that makes it perceptible is banned and the connection between the eye and the light is interrupted, and it becomes invisible .....</p>

<p>.....</p>

<p>44 Applying the "collection" to the coarse form, the self-being, the fine form, the relation and the meaningfulness of the elements, one gains mastery of the material world.</p>

<p>45 This results in supernatural abilities, such as making the body atomic small, etc., perfection of the body and inviolability in the physical properties.</p>

<h4>Part IV About freedom: Kaivalya Pada</h4>

<p><strong>A Man and the nature</strong></p>

<p>1 The wonderful abilities (siddhi) are either congenital or they arise through (medicinal) plants, through sacred words (mantra), through asceticism or through meditation.</p>

<p>If everything were so simple, India would be the land of the Siddhas. Certain siddhi-like abilities are also found in the sphere of occult magic - even without enlightenment.<br>It is also unexplained how the alleged coherence and deep relaxation during TM - meditation can be sustained during the straining foam rubber contractions.</p>

<p>Therefore i personally go out of manipulated measurements (ala <a href="?SCI-Pseudoscience/Crackpot-Science">Popcorn science</a>), as long as the measurements have not been certified by a recognized independent institution.</p>

<h4>Transcendental meditation versus muscle relaxation: two-year follow-up of a controlled experiment.</h4>
Zuroff DC, Schwarz JC Am J Psychiatry 1980 Oct;137(10):1229-21

<p>In this questionnaire survey the authors measured the outcome among 20 students randomly assigned to muscle relaxation training and 19 assigned to transcendental mediatation at one year (the number of respondents in each group was 13 and 16, respectively) and two and one-half years (the number of respondents was 18 and 17, respectively). At both follow-ups there were no differences between the groups in frequency of practice or satisfaction. In both groups, less than 25% reported more than moderate satisfaction, and less than 20% practices as much as once per week. Subjects' expectancies at nine weeks predicted their satisfaction and frequency of practice at two and one-half years. The authors conclude that although some subjects (15%-20%) enjoy and continue to practice transcendental meditation, it is not universally beneficial.</p>

<h2>Natural law</h2>

<p>"Transcendental Consciousness is the Unified Field of Natural Law. Modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Quantum Field Theory</a> (&lt;&lt; P.S. It has of course not ! ) has established, that there is one unified field at the basis of all the creativity of natural law. So when one transcends, one gets into that level of intelligence, which is all-knowingness. This is enlightenment(...and pure nonsense about enlightenment). And one spontaneously begins to think better in every way - and better means right for everyone, useful for everyone, and quickly achieving the desire. That is enlightenment." Maharishi (Ref : <a href="http://www.tm.org/blog/maharishi/enlightenment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TM.org</a>)</p>

<p>According to Maharishi, the Veda is the basis for the countless natural laws, of which today's science knows only a sub-range. Maharishi propagated a 'unified field of all natural laws', which at the same time was the potential of all natural laws. To this there was according to his sight a western scientific and an eastern meditative approach. The Vedas, the Samkhya and the Bhagavad Gita had to serve as a scientific background. He who comes to the source of thought, attains certain faculties and is able to determine his fate within the natural laws.</p>

<p>There is, however, de facto no western scientific access to such high planes, and there will never be any.</p>

<h2>== Natural law party ==</h2>

<p>An offshoot of the sect is the natural law party, which still exists in Austria and in the <a href="http://www.natural-law.org/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">USA</a> [<a href="http://www.bewusstseinstechnologie.de/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MWS</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOpbZC9Gk-U" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> &gt;&gt; Video !</a>; <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/wiki/%C3%96NP" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wiki</a>]</p>

<p>The 'natural law party' proposed that political problems could be solved through alignment with the "Unified Field" of all the laws of nature through the use of the Transcendental Meditation and <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TM-Sidhi_program" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="TM-Sidhi program">TM-Sidhi programs</a>.</p>

<p>"Natural Law" referred to "the ultimate source of order and harmony displayed throughout creation. Harmony with Natural Law could be accomplished by the practice of <a href="?TM-Meditation">Transcendental Meditation</a> and the more advanced techniques. Because of scientific studies of these techniques(alpha waves, alleged <a href="?SCI-Pseudoscience/Coherence">coherence</a>), it considered this to be a science-based approach.</p>

<p>The NLP proposed that a government subsidized group of 7,000<sup> </sup>advanced meditators known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="?Yogic-pseudo-flying" title="Yogic Flying">Yogic Flyers</a> would lower nationwide stress, reduce unemployment,<sup> </sup>raise the gross national product, improve health, reduce crime, and make the country invincible to foreign attack.(Ref : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Law_Party_(United_States)#References" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wiki</a>)</p>

<h2>The Maharishi effect</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mum.edu/about-mum/consciousness-based-education/tm-research/maharishi-effect/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Maharishi effect</a> is one of the alleged siddhi-effects of TM.</p>

<p>With the introduction of the TM-Sidhi program in 1976, the Maharishi had proposed that the square root of one percent of the population practicing the TM-Sidhi program, together at the same time and in the same place, would increase "life-supporting trends".</p>

<p>'For example, a group of 200 practicing the TM-Sidhi program together in a city of four million (100 x 200 x 200) would be sufficient to produce a measurable influence on the whole city; a group of 1,600 in the U.S. would influence 256 million (100 x 1600 x 1600) people, the whole population of the U.S.; and a group of 7,000 would influence 4.9 billion (100 x 7000 x 7000) people, the population of the world at that time'. [&gt;<a href="https://www.mum.edu/tm-research-overview/maharishi-effect/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ref</a>]</p>

<p>These effects have been examined in 14 published studies of members of the movement, including a gathering of over 4,000 people in Washington DC in the summer of 1993.</p>

<p>While empirical studies have been published in peer-reviewed academic journals this research remains controversial and has been characterized as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> by skeptic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="James Randi">James Randi</a> and others.</p>

<p>Maharishi Heaven on Earth Development Corp. was founded in Malibu, California in 1988 by its first president, money manager Monty Guild. It was initially financed by Guild, who donated his shares to Maharishi University of Management. MHOED announced in 1988 that it planned to build 50 low-density "Maharishi Cities of Immortals" across the U.S. and Canada.</p>

<h2>From TM-EX Newsletter, Spring 1992<br><span style="font-size:16px;"></span><br>NEW YORK -&nbsp; ROARK LETTER</h2>
<br>Dear [TM-EX]: This is to confirm to you our previous discussions regarding my time as Chairman of the Physics Department at Maharishi International University. As you know, since then I have ceased doing TM and I am Chairman of the Physics Department at a small liberal arts college [in the Pacific NW].<br><br><em>During my time at MIU,</em> I had occasion to examine the scientific claims of the movement, to interact with those who had reportedly performed the research, to study the metaphysics, philosophy and religion associated with the TM technique, and to work with the founder of the movement and the college. It is my certain belief that the many scientific claims both to factual evidences of unique, beneficial effects of TM and to theoretical relationships between the experience of TM and physics are not only without any reasonable basis, but are in fact in many ways fraudulent. I will briefly try to detail a few of these errors and false claims in this letter.<br><br>While serving on the faculty I discussed the EEG work which purported to show ``increased <a href="http://tmyogicflying.org/eega.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> brain wave coherence</a> while practising the flying technique'' with one of the faculty investigators who had participated in the development of the study, Dr. Michael Dillbeck. My suspicions were generated by <span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;"> knowing the near impossibility of making EEG measurements</span> of weak electric signals coming from an array of electrodes attached to the&nbsp; subject's scalp while the subject is moving.<br><br>The claims and advertisements show a picture of an apparently <span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">"flying'' meditator</span> alongside the claimed coherent brain wave pattern. The initial claim of ``flying'' as my personal experience discovered is merely an energetic muscular ``hopping.''

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px helvetica; width: 700px;">The TM investigator confirmed to me that contrary to the implied claim, the pattern displayed was not of the flying or hopping meditator since the measurement was indeed impossible.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px helvetica; width: 700px;">A similar degree of deception is to be found in the movement's claimed reduction of crime and other negative social phenomena if enough people in a country or in the world begin to meditate. Confirmed to me by investigators at MIU was the suppression of negative evidence that these investigators had collected. Strong bias was present in selecting only data favourable to a conclusion that was made prior to the data collection. Because of the strong authoritarian (essentially cultic) aspects of the movement, only results supporting ideas generated by the movement leadership could receive any hearing. The ``scientific research'' is without objectivity and is at times simply untrue.<br><br>While Chairman of Physics at MIU, I was asked to develop a quantum theory, a unified field theory, which would incorporate consciousness in such a way as to explain the ``flying'' technique as non-ordinary and which would give to the subjective experience of meditation a fundamental role in physics. I found then and I continue to find now such claims preposterous.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px helvetica; width: 700px;">This is what is normally called <span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">'crackpot science.'</span> Although there is substantial work in the physics of quantum mechanics giving to consciousness an essential role, even a causal role, there is no evidence or argument that could connect some sort of universal consciousness to be subjectively experienced with a unified field of all physics. In fact, the existing scientific work suggests just the opposite.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px helvetica; width: 700px;">If consciousness can be talked about at all with regard to the physical world, then it must be in the sense of lying wholly outside of the physical system. Of course quantum mechanical explanations of ``flying'' in such a way as to suggest that this ``flying'' is an apparent violation of the simpler laws of nature, such as gravity, is entirely inappropriate because nothing unusual is happening in the ``flying'' technique which is only hopping. (On the psychological level, something unusual and probably dangerous is happening during this and other advanced TM techniques.)<br><br>The early attempts to relate the experience of TM to the physical nature of reality were by fuzzy analogies. Analogous reasoning may be useful to clarify ideas, but never to establish connecting relationships. Subsequent attempts to produce some sort of physical theory involving TM merely carry the analogies further into the realm of obscure thinking that can perhaps fool the person not conversant with the language of physics but will be usually quickly described as crackpot by the expert physicist.<br><br>My belief is that TM is in its practise and in its theories religious in nature and is based on a pantheistic Hinduism that has been reformulated <span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">to make it attractive to Western minds.</span><br>We in the West have great respect for science and often look to science and technology to explain our world and to solve our problems. (We probably have an over-reliance on science in fact and may turn it into a religion itself.)</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px helvetica; width: 700px;">By TM claiming to be scientific in a most fundamental way, it tries to demand of us a respect we reserve for things thought scientific, rational, efficient, and effective. Under the guise of this false scientific claim then, Hinduism seeks its entrance into our lives. Many innocent individuals who sought only for an effective (scientific) relaxation technique are then exposed to the real dangers of this TM technique and to the misleading philosophy and metaphysics claimed by its proponents. Sincerely,<br><br>Dennis E. Roark, Ph.D.~</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px helvetica; width: 700px;">(N<span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>owadays have the TM - pseudo-flyers helmets with radio transmitters on their heads.)</span></span></p>

<h2>TM - Meditation : Checking and Initiation</h2>

<p>The Transcendental Meditation technique is a simple, natural, effortless procedure practiced for 15-20 minutes in the morning and evening, while sitting comfortably with the eyes closed. During this technique, the individual's awareness settles down and experiences a unique state of restful alertness. As the body becomes deeply relaxed, the mind transcends all mental activity to experience the simplest form of awareness, Transcendental Consciousness.</p>

<p>The experience of Transcendental Consciousness develops the individual's latent creative potential while dissolving accumulated stress and fatigue through the deep rest gained during the practice.This experience enlivens the individual's creativity, dynamism, orderliness, and organizing power,which result in increasing effectiveness and success in daily life.</p>

<p>The Transcendental Meditation technique is scientific, requiring neither specific beliefs nor adoption of a particular lifestyle. (Early presentation by the movement)</p>

<h4><strong>The TM-Meditation and TM-Sidhi Techniques -&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<h2>As reported in the <cite>TM-EX Newsletter,</cite> and from <a href="http://minet.org/mantras.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Minet</a>.</h2>

<p><strong>The TM technique</strong> is simple mental repetition of a "mantra" or word. The TM movement claims that only specific "words" can be used. They claim that the selection of words is based upon a secret formula. Court documents have shed some light on this "secret" process. It is nothing other than a set of words given out by age, and/or age and sex, depending on the teacher training course the TM teacher attended.( Please see bottom of this document !!!)</p>

<p><strong>The TM-Sidhi program </strong> is nothing other than a set of sutras (words or phrases), mentally repeated every fifteen seconds after doing a twenty minute session of TM. Each sutra is repeated twice, with a 15 second pause in between each repetition.</p>

<h2>TM-Sidhi Techniques</h2>

<p>The names of the sutras used in the TM-Sidhi program are:</p>

<p>Friendliness<br>Compassion<br>Happiness<br>Strength of an elephant<br>Bronchial tube<br>Inner light<br>Sun<br>Moon<br>Polestar<br>Trachea<br>Navel<br>Distinction between intellect and transcendence<br>Transcendence intuition<br>Transcendence finest hearing<br>Transcendence finest sight<br>Transcendence finest taste<br>Transcendence finest touch<br>Transcendence finest smell.</p>

<h2>Yogic Flying</h2>

<p>The "levitation" or better foam rubber-"flying" (hopping) technique,&nbsp; propagated&nbsp;as "Yogic Flying,"</p>

<p>is used in the same way as all other sutras:</p>

<p><strong>"Relationship of body and akasha - lightness of cotton fiber."</strong></p>

<p>This phrase is mentally repeated every fifteen seconds after doing a twenty minute session of TM. Each sutra is mentally repeated twice (if time allows 4 times), with a 15 second pause in between each repetition.</p>

<p>After doing the flying sutra for 5-30 minutes, the instruction is to rest for 10-30 minutes and then read the Hindu Scriptures for 5 minutes.</p>

<p>An example of the readings (from the Ninth Mandala of Rig Veda):</p>

<p><cite>Flow Soma, in a most sweet and exhilarating stream, effused for Indra to drink. The all-beholding destroyer of Rakshasas has stepped upon his gold-smitten birthplace, united with the wooden cask. Be the lavish giver of wealth, most bounteous, the destroyer of enemies; bestow on us the riches of the affluent. Come with food to the sacrifice of the mighty gods, and bring us strength and sustenance. To thee we come, O dropping (Soma); for thee only is this our worship day by day, our prayers are to thee, none other.</cite></p>

<h5 align="CENTER">The Steps of Initiation into Transcendental Meditation<br>as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</h5>

<p><cite>These "steps" are memorized by prospective TM initiators during the last 3 to 5 days of Teacher Training Course, Phase III (TTCIII). Prior to being made teachers, course participants (CPs) are tested by course leaders for absolute, verbatim knowledge of this procedure, its wording, and the precise time intervals as quoted below. CPs must pass such a test three times without mistakes or even hesitations in order to be eligible to become TM teachers. </cite><br><br><cite>The dictated text is represented by course leaders as being a direct quote from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi -- including idiosyncratic grammar and phrasing -- and is said to be the only process by which his Transcendental Meditation may be taught successfully. </cite> <cite>According to the restrictions imposed by TTCIII course leaders, they may only be "inscribed in consciousness" -- that is, memorized from dictation -- and may never be written down, in order to preserve the "purity of the teaching." </cite><br><br><cite>The text below represents the "steps" as they were taught in the mid-to-late 70s and may differ somewhat from earlier and later TTCIII courses. They have been transcribed from a qualified, practicing TM teacher's memory and then compared with several other</cite> <cite> TM initiators' memories to confirm the precise wording and timed intervals.</cite><br><br><cite>The striking similarities to the </cite> Checking Notes" <cite> </cite> <cite> and </cite> &lt;--- HREF="http://www.access.digex.net:80/~minet/groupcheck.html"&gt; <cite><em>" 3-Days Checking, Group Check"</em></cite> <cite> </cite> <cite> &lt;--- procedures have been referenced in HTML.&gt;</cite><br>procedures have been cross-referenced.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;The INITIATION</strong></p>

<blockquote><cite>1. Teacher has prepared an altar to Guru Dev, lit a candle and incense, and spread camphor, sandalwood paste, rice, and other ritual offerings in the appropriate ritual containers prior to student's entrance. Two comfortable chairs are also provided directly </cite> <cite>in front of the altar, leaving room for teacher and student to stand before the altar. </cite><br><br><cite>The initiation room is always prepared behind a closed door so that no student may see the altar before entering. Maharishi has said the element of surprise is important for insuring a smooth and deep initiation experience for the student.</cite><br><br><cite>When the student enters the room, teacher accepts fruit, flowers, handkerchief, and </cite> <a href="http://www.minet.org/Documents"> <cite><em>initiation form</em></cite></a> <cite> </cite> <cite> from student -- the items are usually carried in a wicker basket by the student. Teacher briefly glances at initiation form to check the criteria for mantra selection (age and/or sex) and to preserve the illusion of personal mantra selection. Then the teacher begins speaking to the initiate, as they both sit in front of the altar:</cite></blockquote>

<hr size="1">
<p>"In this personal instruction, you will receive a &lt;--- HREF="http://www.minet.org/TM-EX/Spring-91"&gt; <a href="?TM-Meditation/TM-Mantras"><em> mantra,</em></a> or sound, and then the procedure how to use it properly. Once you know the mantra or sound, by tradition, we keep it to our self. Also the actual procedure of meditation that you receive is to be kept private. For maximum results, all that we learn in private, we keep private. Do you agree?"</p>

<blockquote><cite>Teacher must wait for student's assent before continuing.</cite></blockquote>

<p>"Now, please come..."</p>

<blockquote><cite>Teacher rises, stands in front of altar, and indicates where student should stand.</cite></blockquote>

<p>"...stand here. You would like to have a flower?..."</p>

<blockquote><cite>Teacher offers one of student's flowers back to student. The student must take and hold it for the ceremony to continue.</cite></blockquote>

<p><strong>"...and witness the ceremony which I perform in gratitude to the tradition of Masters who have given us this wisdom of integration of life. </strong></p>

<p><strong>"This is a picture of Guru Dev, His Divinity Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, Maharishi's Master, from whom we have this meditation.<br><br>"Now, I'll begin -- and you just witness."</strong></p>

<hr size="1">
<blockquote><cite>2. Teacher performs </cite> puja.</blockquote>

<hr size="1">
<blockquote><cite>At the end of the puja, the teacher sinks to his knees in front of altar while sweeping his right arm -- indicating to initiate that he, too, should kneel. The ceremony may continue if the initiate does not kneel, or "bow down." After a moment, the initiator slowly rises, slowly and softly repeating the initiate's mantra -- without explaining to the initiate that this is his mantra.<br>For the purposes of testing on TTCIII, before prospective teachers actually are given their list of TM mantras, the word "flower" was substituted.</cite></blockquote>

<p>"Flower, flower, flower, flower..."</p>

<blockquote><cite>The teacher beckons to the individual to repeat with hand motions. If he doesn't begin repeating the mantra, then the teacher says:</cite></blockquote>

<p><strong>"Repeat: Flower, flower, flower, flower...." (in practice : the given Mantra)</strong></p>

<blockquote><cite>The teacher ceases repeating the mantra, indicating with hand motions that the student should continue. The teacher waits for the student to repeat the mantra 3 or 4 times on his own, then motions him to sit in the provided chair. The teacher might say:</cite></blockquote>

<p>"Continue...."</p>

<blockquote>(15 seconds)</blockquote>

<p>"Now, close the eyes and continue."</p>

<blockquote>(wait 15 seconds)</blockquote>

<p>"More quietly."</p>

<blockquote>(15 seconds, the teacher softens the voice each time "more quietly" is repeated)</blockquote>

<p>"More quietly."</p>

<blockquote>(15 seconds)</blockquote>

<p>"More quietly."</p>

<blockquote>(15 seconds)</blockquote>

<p>"Now, mentally -- without moving tongue or lips."</p>

<blockquote>(wait 15 seconds)</blockquote>

<p>"Open the eyes."</p>

<blockquote><cite>Wait for him to open the eyes.</cite></blockquote>

<p>"It's easy? <em><span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Mental repetition is not a clear pronunciation, it's a faint idea.</span></em> And if at any time you seem to be forgetting the mantra, don't try to hold on. Let it go. Now, close the eyes and continue."</p>

<blockquote>(2 minutes)</blockquote>

<p>"Open the eyes."</p>

<blockquote><cite>Wait for him to open the eyes.</cite></blockquote>

<p>"It's easy? You feel some relaxation? This is Transcendental Meditation. See, how simple it is? It goes almost by itself. We don't concentrate. We don't control the mind. Just think the mantra easily, effortlessly. And if at any time you seem to be forgetting the mantra, don't try to hold on. Let it go. If a thought comes, easily come back to the mantra. Now, close the eyes and continue."</p>

<blockquote>(10 minutes)</blockquote>

<p>"Open the eyes slowly."</p>

<blockquote>(15 seconds)</blockquote>

<p>"It's good? Relaxing? See how simple it is? Did you feel sometimes the mantra was forgotten and thoughts came? How many times this happened -- two, three times? It's good. <em><span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Whenever we forget the mantra, we quietly come back to it. It's a very simple, natural process. Now, you'll sit in this room and meditate for a while. After some time I'll come and then we'll talk more about it.</span></em></p>

<blockquote><cite>The Teacher closes his eyes as an example and after a minute leaves the room as the meditator continues to meditate by himself for 20 minutes -- or if he is under 18, one minute for every year of age. When the teacher returns, he offers the meditator the Initiation Day Questionnaire to fill out and discusses experiences with him -- based on the <span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">General Points</span> of the Checking Procedure. He tells the new initiate to meditate in this way in the afternoon at home, and then again in the morning and afternoon of the next day. Finally, he reminds him of the time and place of the First Day's Checking meeting. </cite></blockquote>

<h4 align="CENTER">GENERAL POINTS</h4>

<p>The instructions in the following are to be used as and when necessary -- <cite>we talk only on what he is talking </cite> -- only that part of the point that is useful or applicable to his situation should be used. Checkers should be careful to mention negative aspects as little as possible.</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPA"></a><strong>A.</strong></p>

<blockquote><cite>"If during the period of 2 minutes of silence, at the end of meditation, there is some sensation in the body, some movement anywhere in the body, in the heart or head, or some pressure somewhere, then let the mind continue to feel it. Be with it innocently</cite> <cite>, as it is, even if it increases or decreases in intensity. This is the time to _not_ open the eyes until the sensation has significantly diminished or faded away. Usually it happens after 2 or 3 minutes. But in case the sensation is strong and shows no si</cite> <cite>gn of diminishing or dissolving then the only thing to do is to continue with it in the same innocent and easy way.</cite><br><br><cite>"Or lie down and rest for 5 or 10 minutes and if you feel sleepy and doze off, don't mind the time and come out when you naturally wake up. Maybe some sleepiness comes in 5 to 10 minutes. This will indicate that some big block of stress is dissolved and no</cite> <cite>w the system is free for greater enjoyment and accomplishment."</cite></blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>Such cases of many minutes of continued sensations or stress will be rare, but if stress is there, it is wise to allow it to dissolve through this innocent procedure. (This is after meditation.) This information will be given during the three days of check ing.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPB"></a><strong>B.</strong><a name="GPB"></a></p>

<blockquote><cite>"Maybe at any time during meditation you feel sleepy, don't try to be alert in order to think the mantra. If sleep comes, let it come. Sleep either sitting or if it seems to be too strong lie down in bed and sleep. Maybe in 5, 10 minutes or half an hour --</cite> <cite> whenever you are awake, it will be good to sit and meditate, even for 5 or 10 minutes because this rest has revitalized the nervous system and it's now ready for much clearer experiences of finer states of the mantra. Always if we fall asleep during medit</cite> <cite>ation, we meditate immediately after waking up."</cite></blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPC"></a><strong>C.</strong></p>

<blockquote><cite>"One piece of information which it will be good to have is that _if_ ("if" is very important here), if at all, at any time it happens that during meditation we suddenly feel that any particular thought is overpowering and at that time it is not possible to pick up the mantra, then we don't try to pick up the mantra by force against the thought, just let the mind be easy, without trying to pick up the mantra. In this easy state the mind will naturally be drawn to some physical sensation in the body. This physical sensation born of the release of some deep stress in that area is causing that powerful thought. As the attention is innocently drawn to the physical sensation, the process of release of stress is facilitated, causing the release to be more thorough and at the same time more smooth and easy."</cite></blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>The shifting of the attention from the mental thought to the physical sensation has yet another value in that the mind is saved from the influence of the meaning of the thought. And this saves the psychology of the meditator from being spoiled by the nature or quality of stress that is being released.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><cite>"As the sensation begins to diminish it will cease to grip the mind and naturally the mind will begin to entertain other thoughts. When the thoughts start coming in this is the indication that the sensation is no longer dominating and this is the time to start the mantra."</cite></blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPD"></a><strong>D.</strong></p>

<blockquote><cite>"It is an important principle to note, that at any time that the mind is capable of thinking any thought it is capable of thinking the mantra. Another point of importance to remember is that to allow the mind to continue feeling any faint sensation at the </cite> <cite>time the mind is capable of thinking thoughts and therefore capable of thinking the mantra is not the process of Transcendental Meditation and has the effect of making the mind lazy and weakening the system."</cite></blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>The meditator may not feel this lethargic influence in the system as he unnecessarily prolongs "feeling the body." The reason for this is that when he meditates using the mantra properly he does dive deep into finer levels of energy and thereby feels more energetic. This compensates for the weakening influence produced by prolonged feeling of physical sensations.<br><br>The very knowledge that the energy gained during meditation is used up (to whatever extent doesn't matter) to compensate for the weakening influence caused by deviating from the subtleties of instruction for right meditation should be enough for any meditator to refrain from prolonging "body feeling" once the thoughts have started to come and the mind can think the mantra.</li>
    <li>Note for checker: This principle of disallowing prolonged "body feeling" is however not to be confused with the special instructions given to initiators for certain mental cases.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPE"></a><strong>E.</strong></p>

<blockquote><cite>"When we feel that we gain more energy in daily life it is important not to spend more energy than we gain. Take it easy, and always take time to meditate regularly. What has been experienced in different parts of the world is this: When a man starts to me</cite> <cite>ditate, within two or three days or weeks he begins to feel so fresh and full of energy that naturally he cannot resist entertaining greater activity. This is also due to the reason that he enjoys his activity more. This is the natural results of meditatio</cite> <cite>n, but there should be a limit of the increase of activity. If one increases activity more than the proportion of the increase of energy, then it will be naturally inevitable that one gathers fatigue.</cite><br><br><cite>"This is generally witnessed in the case of busy businessmen. They start to do more business yet feeling fresh they naturally want to do even more. Having unduly increased their business responsibilities they soon start gathering fatigue and find that they</cite> <cite> cannot cope with their increased responsibilities. The result is anxiety and this brings fatigue. With the loss of balance of mind, the first thing they naturally find is that they have so much to do that there is not time for meditation. </cite><br><br><cite>"This is like a gardener who has been watering the root everyday and when the fruits are ripe he is engaged in eating and enjoying them so much that he does not find time to water the root. Therefore, whatever the increasing energy level through meditation</cite> <cite> and whatever the increasing level of accomplishment, we should be innocently trying not to skip meditation because of the increased amount of responsibility and interest in work. The need to be regular in meditation is even more important when a man incre</cite> <cite>ases his responsibilities and undertakings."</cite></blockquote>

<hr>
<h5><strong>F.</strong></h5>

<blockquote><cite>"Regularity in meditation is of utmost importance and we always start with half a minute of silence and end with two minutes of silence."</cite></blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>People who have been meditating more than three years are sometimes recommended by the initiator that, if they have time, they can meditate 30 or 40 minutes. If they ask the checker how long they should meditate, the checker should say:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><cite>"20 minutes is the usual time of each sitting of meditation. But if for any reason your initiator has advised you for longer or shorter periods of meditation it is better to go by this advice."</cite></blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPG"></a><strong>G.</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>In case a man complains that the mantra is going with the heartbeat or breath or tick tick of the clock, we say:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><cite>"We take it easy, we don't try to associate the mantra with the heartbeat or breath or tick tick of the clock. Only that we are not concerned with this heartbeat.... Mantra is our concern. If heartbeat comes along we don't mind. Neither we try to maintain the heartbeat with the mantra nor we try to forget about it. Mantra is all our concern. Innocently we favor the mantra. As when we are walking on a road if someone is found walking by our side we just don't mind."</cite></blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPH"></a><strong>H.</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Sometimes, if someone is exposed to some unsuitable food which has resulted in influencing the digestive system, then the experiences will not be fascinating. In such a state even the points of checking will not prove to be very effective.<br><br>In such a case, after checking, it may be good to ask him if he has within 2 or 3 days eaten something after which he feels meditation is not to good as before. But in asking, be careful that you don't give an impression of great horror.<br><br>Just say to him:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><cite>"</cite> <cite>It doesn't matter, sometimes it happens. You don't have to worry much about it. If something wrong has been eaten, the effect of that will only last for 2 or 3 days and then you will have good meditation. What you have to do is just be regular in practice. It won't be good to stop for 2 or 3 days. Keep on meditating without effort, just not minding at this time whether the meditation is good or not."</cite></blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPI"></a><strong>J.</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Even tiredness can sometimes bring the influence of unsuitable food. The same situation can be found in case of medicine. If a man asks, "I don't want to take medicine because it will influence my meditation," tell him:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><cite>"Remaining ill will spoil the meditation more than the use of medicine. The advice is to choose the lesser evil. If we have to choose between illness or medicine, it is more useful to decide for medicine and against sickness. The effect of medicine, even if it overshadows clear meditations, is, in the final analysis, useful even in the cause of meditation."</cite></blockquote>

<p><a name="GPJ"></a><strong>J.</strong></p>

<p><a name="GPJ"></a> Pregnant women may meditate as much as is comfortable in their daily routine.</p>

<hr>
<h5><strong>K.</strong></h5>

<p>With reference to point number 29A:<br><br>If after 10 minutes meditation some difficulty arises and we need to return to point number 24 to give a further period of 3-4 minutes of meditation, then continue also to point number 27,<cite>if time allows,</cite> so that the meditator finishes with 10 minutes of easy, comfortable meditation.</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPL"></a><strong>L.</strong></p>

<blockquote><cite>"When we meditate at home, we don't open and close the eyes many times before starting the mantra."</cite></blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPM"></a><strong>M.</strong></p>

<p>Shaking, etc. (expressions of release of stress)</p>

<blockquote><cite>"These are all expressions of the release of stress. Because meditation is a natural process, naturally the body twists and turns in a manner which is favorable to the release of some specific stress. The way to meet with this situation is to 1) take it as it comes. Never do we try to physically resist the movement. If the movements become violent and seem to be going out of hand, then instead of physically trying to stop them, we can open the eyes so that our awareness comes out. With this the movements will naturally become less violent and stop. Opening the eyes is one thing we do from our side.</cite><br><br><cite>"2) We don't cooperate with the movements in order to continue them. That means: we do not hold in our mind the idea that because these movements are the expressions of release of stress, and the they are allowed to go on the more the stress will be released, therefore let me enjoy the movements and continue them. If there is a slightest willingness to promote movements in order to release stress, then the chances are that the movements will continue even beyond their natural need.</cite><br><br><cite>"3) It is safer to hold the idea in our mind that it is, after all, absolutely necessary that the movements should go on; even without movements the stress can be released. This idea in the mind without any application of physical force to stop movements w</cite> <cite>ill be found to be useful in naturally stopping the movements, but if in spite of this attitude, the movements tend to continue, then we know that they are necessary; we just be with them."</cite></blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPN"></a><strong>N.</strong></p>

<p><a name="GPN"></a><a> In case during checking we feel that man may be shy to say "no" to any point, just at that moment it will be good to verify his quote "yes" by asking him "How did you feel?" or "How is it?", so he has a chance to elaborate on that "yes" just so we can see that his quote "yes" is genuine and not out of shyness.</a></p>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPO"></a><strong>O.</strong></p>

<p><a> To be used in advising a man how to handle pain or pressure at home.</a></p>

<blockquote><cite>"Sometimes it may happen that a person complains of pressure in the forehead, back of the head, or pain in the temples, or pain in the neck, appearing during meditation. This may be due to 2 different reasons:</cite><br><cite>"1. Due to some faint or weak element of pain existing somewhere in the head, inside somewhere, which is not experienced when the awareness is in the gross and which begins to be experienced when the attention reaches that subtle level. In such a situation</cite> <cite>, one can't do anything other than experience it or go through the experience of it whenever it starts to be felt. This feeling of pain will inevitably continue time after time in almost every meditation until the wound is healed completely or until the si</cite> <cite>tuation is repaired. This situation may also be said to be the experience of pain during meditation arising from the process of release of stress. The formula in this case is take it as it comes and allow it to go the way it can go.</cite><br><br><cite>"2. Some effort to meditate some trying to think the mantra -- some intention even faint to continue thinking the mantra or some idea to continue to experience the mantra or comprehend very faint states of the mantra -- all this can be summarized in one wo</cite> <cite>rd: effort during meditation. This can certainly be remedied by stopping repeating the mantra the moment the pain begins to dominate (bringing the attention to the mantra at this time would be a strain) and sitting doing nothing until the pain has somewhat</cite> <cite> diminished. Maybe it will take a few seconds or half a minute or one minute. Then start the mantra again.</cite><br><br><cite>"This procedure of stopping the mantra the moment pain begins to dominate at any time during meditation should be adopted for both situations, number one or number two. It is not necessary to try to locate the reason, whether the headache is from situation</cite> <cite> number one or number two, because there is no way to determine the exact cause of this experience of pain during meditation.</cite><br><br><cite>"Any experience of pain in the head, heart, or anywhere arising during meditation should be handled in this way.</cite><br><br><cite>"Regarding pain in the neck: After sitting 2 minutes without the mantra with eyes closed, one may bring the head forward and backward and if necessary roll the head in a way that the neck feels increasingly comfortable."</cite></blockquote>

<hr>
<p><a name="GPP"></a><strong>P. </strong></p>

<blockquote><cite>"If at any time during meditation we become aware that the head is tilted forward and is not erect, it may be better to very slowly and easily bring the head back to an upright position. In case it is uncomfortable to bring it upright then leave it the way</cite> <cite> it is and continue to enjoy meditation.</cite><br><br><cite>"If the head is tilted back then rather than strain the neck to bring the head forward, we should bend forward very slowly and easily from the waist allowing the head to come forward gently. Then sit up and continue meditation.</cite><br><br><cite>"If we become aware that the head is moving from front to back or sideways, we shouldn't try to this movement. When the moving has stopped, then we easily bring the head back upright following the above instructions."</cite></blockquote>

<h2 align="CENTER">Checking Procedure</h2>

<p><a name="INTRO"></a> Not to be given out except by initiators through verbal dictation in training checkers.<br><br>The purpose of checking is to give the experience of right meditation. For this it is necessary to give the experience of the right start. To give the right start, first the meditator experiences how he thinks. To experience how he normally, naturally thin ks, let him sit easily, comfortably. Then indicate to him that thinking is a process that is effortless in that quietness.<br><br>Checking does not involve talking. And we don't investigate into any faults. Just give him the experience of effortless natural thinking. Whatever is the complaint against meditation, whatever is the difficulty take the man through the necessary steps for checking, and he will feel better.</p>

<hr>
<p><br>Before you start checking, just one or two minutes listen with interest and patience to the story of his meditation, but only if he is eager to talk, so that he may know that you are interested in him. Otherwise don't embark on questioning and don't try to find the fault in his meditation. Just say: "Yes, but now this will be better," or "All right, we will see how it is."<br><br>Many meditators only come for a routine checking with no special complaint. In both cases, whether he complains or not, it will be good to ask him:</p>

<blockquote><cite>"</cite> <cite>How long have you been meditating?"</cite><br><br><cite>"When was the last time you meditated?"</cite></blockquote>

<p><a name="IRREGULAR"></a></p>

<ul>
    <li><a name="IRREGULAR"></a> If his answer indicates that he had not been regular or has not meditated for some time, we say:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><cite>"</cite> <cite>It doesn't matter, we will see how you feel after checking" -</cite><cite> </cite> <cite> have you been meditating each time?"</cite></blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>Always ask:</li>

<blockquote><cite>"</cite> <cite>About </cite> <cite><em>how many minutes</em></cite> <cite> </cite> <cite> have you been meditating each time?"</cite></blockquote>

    <li>Whatever he says, we acknowledge by a word:</li>

        <blockquote><cite>"In this meditation, we do not concentrate, we do not try to think the mantra clearly. Mental repetition is not a clear pronunciation. It is just a faint idea.

<p>At this point you should also close your eyes and meditate or leave him by himself. But if you stay with him, it is advisable to glance at his face from time to time to see that there are no signs of straining, but actually he may not have been straining o n the mantra. This sign of strain may be the expression of natural release of stress. We shall find confirmation of this when we check the success of his meditation at the end of ten minutes.<br><br>It is important that the checker never gives the impression that he notices some change in the meditator. A meditator should never feel that the checker has been watching him closely while he was meditating.</p>

<span color="#FF0000" size="3" style="color: #ff0000; font-size: medium;">Part 1 - An Overview: The Transcendental Meditation Program</span>
-----------------------------------------------------------
From: TM-EX Bulletin, November, 1991
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">HISTORY</span>:   Transcendental Meditation (TM), was initiated in India,
October 1955, by the then called Maharishi Bala Brahmachari Mahesh
Yogi Maharaj (life long celibate student and great seer), now called
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (great seer).  When asked about his wealth,
Maharishi claims to be only a simple monk without pockets.  He lives
in TM facilities with silk-lined walls, flies in personal helicopters
and has had a private 707 jet.
His teaching evolved from an overtly religious one; admitting the
mantras (word used to meditate upon) are "personal gods" with the
practice called "Spiritual Sadhana," "Deep Meditation," or the
cleverly disguised trademarked brand "Transcendental Meditation
Program."
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">MARKETING:</span>  TM is now marketed under many front groups and names such
as:  Corporate Development Program, Science of Creative Intelligence,
Technology of the Unified Field and the current approach of the
Maharishi Ayur-Veda health program/centers.
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">RELIGION:</span>  Although TM publicly denies its religious nature, the U.S.
Court of Appeals declared TM to be a religion and not suitable for the
public schools.  The original TM incorporation in the U.S. was as a
religious entity.  Maharishi teaches that God will not listen to your
prayers without TM.
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">MANTRAS:</span>  The mantras are chosen based upon secret criteria of
"neurophysiological specificity."  Court documents reveal that they
are chosen on the basis of age and/or age and sex.  The highly secret
words are the names associated with Hindu deities (Shyama = Krishna).
"We select only mantras of personal gods... such mantras fetch to us
the grace of personal gods" -- Maharishi.  Mantras are given in a
candlelit incense-filled room, during an initiation ceremony where the
teacher encourages the student to bow before the picture of
Maharishi's dead teacher.
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">SUPERNORMAL POWERS:</span>  The movement claims its followers will develop
powers of: levitation, invisibility, reading minds, perfect health,
immortality and more.
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">WORLD PEACE: </span> Maharishi's World Peace Projects have been instituted in
many countries, including Israel.  Maharishi teaches that one
meditator is powerful enough to reduce the crime rate.  The movement
claims a group of 7000 meditating levitators or "Sidhas" assembled in
one location will create world peace and economic stability.  Research
on the Israel project has been found to be deceptive and lacking
scientific credibility.
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">POLITICS:</span>  The Maharishi's Absolute Theory of Government holds "a
government is just the innocent reflection of the consciousness of its
people."  In 1976, Maharishi formed the "World Government" to handle
the "consciousness" of the world.  <span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Phillippine president Marcos</span> took
the Maharishi's offer to heart and the Age of Enlightenment Foundation
nearly succeeded in acquiring the largest university in Asia.  Action
from church groups, the Vatican and former members stopped the
takeover.  Currently the government of <span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Zambia</span> has taken the
Maharishi's offer to heart and has pledged 44 million acres of land
(one-fourth of the land mass) to the Age of Enlightenment Foundation.
[The government of Zambia, after elections, has terminated this deal
and Maharishi's representatives have left the country. See TM-EX
Newsletter, Summer 1992 -ed]
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">MONEY: </span> Involvement in TM is not cheap.  Organized as a non-profit
educational organization, the TM movement is valued between $2 and $3
BILLION dollars.  Initiation starts at $390 [now  $1000 -ed],
followed by advanced mantras at $390, health mantras at $700,
psychophysiological techniques at $700, herbs for $1000 per year,
cleansing programs from $2700 - $6600, yagyas (religious ceremonies
performed to solicit the aid of one or more Hindu deities), Jyotish
(Hindu astrology TM-style), Ayur-Veda prescribed gems, Maharishi school
and university education, and more.  To pursue TM to its end can cost
over $10,000 per year.
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">RETREATS: </span> Advanced courses often taught in remote locations.  Contact
with outsiders, newspapers and television are highly discouraged.
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">LANGUAGE: </span> TM courses and literature are filled with buzz words and
cliches that serve the function of stopping the critical thought
processes ("unstressing," "support of nature," "karma").
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">ISRAEL:</span>  TM has targeted Israel during the past few years including
initiating a program entitled "Bring Invincibility to Israel" which
has brought American Jews to Israel to learn to levitate for $2500 per
participant.
In 1980, Hararit became the first TM communal settlement in israel,
located at Mount Netufa in Galilee.  TM since has made inroads in
Kibbutzim throughout Galilee.
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">HARMFUL EFFECTS:</span>  Studies have found TM results in tiredness, anxiety,
depression, regression, suicidal tendencies, headaches, sleeping
difficulties, neck pain and involuntary twitching for many.  The
German government studies found that the teachers of TM were not
qualified to deal with the problems associated with its practice.
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">WARNINGS:</span>  Warnings have been issued about the dangers of TM by the
German government, the Vatican, the Cult Awareness Network, the Task
Force on Missionaries and Cults, the Interfaith Coalition of Concern
about Cults and various professional organizations.

Transcendental Meditation program
---------------------------------
From: TM-EX Newsletter, Spring, 1991
<span color="#0000FF" size="3" style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">MANTRAS:</span> Separating Fact from Fiction
According to the TM doctrine, the mantra is a critical part of
learning the meditation process. A mantra must be selected for the
individual by a qualified teacher. ``It becomes extremely important
that the correct sound be selected for each individual.''
They claim the mantras used in TM come from an ancient Indian
tradition known as the ``Vedic Shankaracharya Tradition.'' According
to TM publications, the ``Shankaracharya tradition has preserved not
only these sounds, but also a system of rules or formulae by which
they are to be assigned to individuals.''
At the introductory lecture, the mantras are said to be ``meaningless
sounds whose effects are known'' that are chosen for the individual
based upon a trade secret formula.
A search of TM documents has uncovered the following statement by
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of TM:
WE CAN TAKE ANY WORD. EVEN THE WORD ``MIKE'' CAN BE TAKEN . . . THUS
WE FIND THAT ANY SOUND CAN SERVE OUR PURPOSE OF TRAINING THE MIND
TO BECOME SHARP.
He goes on to say:
FOR OUR PRACTICE, WE SELECT ONLY THE SUITABLE MANTRAS OF PERSONAL
GODS. SUCH MANTRAS FETCH TO US THE GRACE OF PERSONAL GODS AND MAKE
US HAPPIER IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE.
How are the TM mantras given?
The mantras is given in a private ``initiation'' ceremony, or ``puja,''
in which the initiate brings fresh fruit, flowers and a new handkerchief,
to be offered to a picture of Maharishi's deceased ``Master'' in an
incense-filled, candlelit room.  The recruit is warned not to reveal
the mantra because it is destructive of the teaching and will weaken
the process of TM.
The puja is said to protect the teaching so that nothing is added
or subtracted.    Its performance  is said to insure that TM is  taught
without change, as purportedly it has been taught  for the last 5000
years.
Court documents reveal that many methods for choosing mantras have
been used by the TM movement for the past 30 years.  The mantras are
chosen on the basis of age, and/or age and sex, depending on the particular
teacher training course the initiator [TM-teacher] was trained.  [see
box]  A psychologist's explanation of the initiation process is called
``hypnotic trance induction.''~

From: Reid J Mullen &lt;rjmst30+@pitt.edu&gt;
    There are only six main sounds used in Tm. They are: e, ai,
shiri, hiri, kiri, and sham. Next, there are only five possible
endings for any of the Tm mantras. Those endings are: m, n, ng,
nga, and ma. By combining the six root sounds with the five en-
dings, you come up with the 16 mantras used in Tm. Since all of
Tm's mantras are assigned on the basis of age. Let me give you
an updated list (as of 1987). Here now is the list:
Age:              Mantra:              Age:            Mantra:

From: Cindy Boin &lt;boin@library.vanderbilt.edu&gt;
When I was first made an initiator, I was 19 years old. I was made a
junior initiator (and boy, was I pissed! :-)) This meant, I was only
allowed to initiate people who were 21 and younger. So I was given
mantras suitable for people up to that age.
Later, on an ATR course, I was made a full initiator (on the phone,
by MMY). My instruction? To use the mantra I'd been given for 18-21
year olds for everyone above that age, as well. So any adult I
initiated got the same mantra.

From: Pat Ryan (jk840@delphi.com)
... The technique is simple (it really is hypnosis): close your eyes -
wait about half a minute, then start thinking the mantra over and over
again.
At the end of meditation stop thinking the mantra and wait about 2
minutes before opening the eyes.
Some notes on correct meditation (from the TM Checking notes):
:: In this meditation, we do not concentrate, we do not try to say the
:: mantra clearly.  Mental repetition is not a clear pronunciation, it is
:: just a faint idea.
:: We don't try to make a rhythm of the mantra.  We don't try to control
:: thoughts.  If a thought comes, we do not try to push it out.  When we
:: become aware that we are not thinking  the mantra, then we quietly come
:: back to the mantra.
:: Very easily we think the mantra and if at any moment we feel that we
:: are forgetting it, we should not try to persist in repeating it or try
:: to keep on remembering it.  Only very easily we start and take it as
:: it comes and do not hold the mantra if it tends to slip away.  The
:: mantra may change in different ways.  It can get faster or slower,
:: louder or softer, clearer or fainter.  Its pronunciation may change,
:: lengthen or shorten or even may appear to be distorted or it may not
:: appear to change at all.  In every case, we take it as it comes,
:: neither anticipating nor resisting change, just simple innocence.
From: Reid J Mullen &lt;rjmst30+@pitt.edu&gt;
 - The mantra is [ not ] repeated over and over during the prac-
   tice of the Tm technique. Rather it is (heard). We think the
   mantra once at the beginning of meditation and then we let it
   go. As has been stated already: We allow the mantra to change
   in any way it wants. It can get louder, softer or fainter. It
   also says in the checking notes that its pronunciation is sub-
   ject to change. The mantra may speed up or slow down. Whatever
   the case is, we don't mind. We just take it as it comes. This
   bit of instruction is very important. To repeat something ov-
   er and over is to (chant), or otherwise manipulate the mantra
   in some way. Any manipulation of the mantra is incorrect prac-
   tice of the technique and will not produce the soothing an re-
   juvenating experience of settling down into pure consciousness
   and experiencing that profound state of deep rest. The key to
   practicing the Tm technique properly is to remember four basic
   things:
   1. Hearing is a form of thinking. By introducing the mantra an
      then letting it go, hearing it in whatever state its in, we
      are thinking the mantra effortlessly. This effortless think-
      ing of the mantra is the correct practice of Tm.
   2. Thoughts should be allowed to come and go (naturally) along
      with the mantra. We should in no way (try) to push thoughts
      out of our mind or use the mantra to override them. They are
      a natural part of the Tm technique.
   3. When the mantra disappears and the mind goes off on thoughts
      we quietly come back to it. This means that all we have to do
      is become (aware) that we are no longer: (hearing the mantra
      in whatever state its in) and the awareness of that, will be
      quite sufficient to bring the mantra back to us.
   4. Finally, if we should find that the mantra is vague and un-
      clear when it returns, we let it be as it is. We make abso-
      lutely no attempt to make it clear.
From: Pat Ryan (jk840@delphi.com)
A word of warning: Many studies (the movement has tried to suppress)
have found that approximately 40% of the people who practice TM
develop adverse effects.
If it helps do it, if you have any problems S T O P.  Because TM is a
religion (The courts in the US have ruled it to be) for a TM teacher
to admit that TM is not good for you would be like a Christian saying
belief in Jesus is not good for you, it will never happen.
Well, you just saved $1000.
Most TM'ers get advanced techniques of TM about every 18 months.  They
also cost $1000.  The advanced techniques of TM are as follows.
1st  Aing Namah
2nd  Shri Aing Namah
3rd  Shri Aing Namah Namah
4th  Shri Shri Aing Namah Namah
5th  Shri Shri Aing Aing Namah Namah
6th  Shri Shri Aing Aing Namah Namah
     (The mantra is thought in the heart area of the body).
Shri = oh most beautiful
Aing = Hindu goddess saraswati
Namah = I bow down
TM-Sidhi program
----------------
From: Pat Ryan (jk840@delphi.com)
In the court transcripts of Kropinski vs Yogi and in public domain the
TM-Sidhi program  has been published.
During one court hearing the *movement* attempted to acquire a
temporary restraining order - to stop former members from revealing
the program.  They argued that former members had signed agreement
forms not to disclose the program.  The judge did not agree with the
movement's argument.
So here is the program for free:
The TM-Sidhi program is nothing other than a set of sutras (words or
phrases), mentally repeated every fifteen seconds after doing a twenty
minute session of TM.  Each sutra is mentally repeated twice (if time
allows 4 times) - a 15 second pause in between each repetition.
The sutras used in the TM-Sidhi program are:  Friendliness,
Compassion, Happiness, Strength of an elephant, Bronchial tube, Inner
light, Sun, Moon, Polestar, Trachea, Navel, Distinction between
intellect and transcendence, Transcendence intuition, Transcendence
finest hearing, Transcendence finest sight, Transcendence finest taste,
Transcendence finest smell.
The much touted *levitation* or yogic flying technique is a sutra
repeated in the same way as other sutras:
:: RELATIONSHIP OF BODY AND AKASHA - LIGHTNESS OF COTTON FIBER.
After doing the flying sutra for 5-30 minutes, the instruction is to rest
for 10-30 minutes and then read the Hindu Scriptures for 5 minutes.
An example of the readings (from the Ninth Mandala of Rig Veda):
:: "Flow Soma, in a most sweet and exhilarating stream, effused for Indra
:: to drink.  The all-beholding destroyer of Rakshasas has stepped upon
:: his gold-smitten birthplace, united with the wooden cask.  Be the
:: lavish giver of wealth, most bounteous, the destroyer of enemies;
:: bestow on us the riches of the affluent.  Come with food to the
:: sacrifice of the mighty gods, and bring us strength and sustenance.
:: To thee we come, O dropping (Soma); for thee only is this our worship
:: day by day, our prayers are to thee, none other."

I spent seven years hopping around in a trance state, save your money,
save your time, save your ability to think, don't  bother with TM.

</span>----------------------------
Excerpted from TM-EX Newsletter, Summer 1991
TWENTY APPROACHES TO MAHARISHI AYUR-VEDA:  THEIR COSTS, GENERAL
RECOMMENDATIONS AND EXPLANATION:
To achieve this state of perfect balance, Maharishi Ayur-Veda [now]
advocates 20 complementary approaches.  When used together, the 20
approaches of Maharishi Ayur-Veda ensure perfect health for the
individual, the family, the nation, and the world. /52
1.  Approaches from Consciousness:  Development of higher states of
consciousness through Maharishi's Transcendental Meditation [TM], its
Advanced Techniques, and the TM-Sidhi Programme. /53
Individuals not practicing the TM program are expected to learn this
as part of their Maharishi Ayurveda Health program.  /54
The TM technique is a simple mental repetition of a sound or "mantra."
/55  The TM movement claims that only specific "sounds" can be used,
and that the selection of sounds is based upon a trade secret. /56
The mantra is given in a private "initiation" ceremony, or "puja,"
[worship to Lord Narayana, the lotus born Brahma, the creator... the
whole galaxy of gods pray for perfection... guru is god] in which the
initiate brings fresh fruit, flowers and a new handkerchief, to be
offered to a picture of Maharishi's deceased "Master" in an
incense-filled, candlelit room. /57  The recruit is warned not to
reveal the mantra because it is destructive of the teaching and will
weaken the process of TM.  A similar degree of secrecy is found
throughout Maharishi's teachings.  /58 /59
The instructor, or "initiator" who has signed an oath of loyalty to
Maharishi, gives the deliberate impression that there are very large
numbers of mantras, and that each meditator receives a mantra which is
uniquely suited to his personality, health, feelings, education,
profession and marital status. /60 /61
Court documents have shown that the "secret" mantra formula consists
of a limited number of words associated with Hindu deities, including:
Shiama=Krishna, Aing=Sarasvati, Hiring=Shiva, Kiring=Kali, and given
out by age, and/or age and sex depending upon the criteria used at the
time the TM teacher was "given" the mantras. /62  In an internal
document Maharishi says:  "For training the mind through sound we can
take any word, even the word 'mike.'  For our purpose we select only
the suitable mantras of personal gods." /63  Many scholars verify that
TM is a religion. /64 /65 /66 /67 COST:  $390 /68 (now $1,000 -ed)
TM Advanced Techniques add the words 'shri' [O most beautiful] and
'namah' [I bow down] as prefix and/or suffix to the basic mantra.
COST:  $390 (now $1,000 -ed)
The TM-Sidhi program is mental repetition of "sutras" (words or
phrases) after a twenty minute session of TM.  Examples of the sutras
used in the TM-Sidhi program include: 'friendliness,' 'strength of an
elephant,' 'sun,' and 'navel.'  The levitation "flying" sutra:
"Relationship of body and akasha, lightness of cotton fiber." /69
This practice is followed by readings of Hindu scriptures, i.e.:
"Flow, Soma, in a most sweet and exhilarating stream, effused for
Indra to drink.  To thee we come, O dropping (Soma); for thee only is
this our worship day by day, our prayers are to thee, none other..."
/70  COST:  $3,000 (Transportation and hotel additional)
TM Residence Courses and "World Peace Assemblies" are in-residence
courses where the amount of time spent in meditation or "flying" is
increased.  Maharishi philosophy and lifestyle is taught at these
courses.  COSTS Residence courses, $195 (3 day weekend); World Peace
Assembly, $895 (week long courses should be taken four times a year)
2. Primordial Sound:  Use of the primordial sounds of the Samhita of
the four aspects of the Ved and their Ved-Angas and Up-Angas to
eliminate imbalances in the functioning of human nature and nature as
a whole. /71
The word "Amrita," which is Sanskrit for "the nectar of immortality"
is mentally repeated.  "A unique program offered as a professional
medical service."  COST $700
3. Intellect:  To correct the mistake of the intellect,
Pragya-aparadha, so that the totality of the unified structure of life
is perceived while one is perceiving the diversified structure.  In
this state of knowledge, the Self, disease cannot flourish because
life is intimately connected with the source of natural law. /72  The
ultimate root of every disease is ignorance. /73
This is accomplished through exposure to Maharishi's teachings,
including formal schooling, courses, and written, audio and video
materials. /74 /75 /76  COSTS  Maharishi Children's School,  $3,800,
elementary/$4,200, middle school.  Maharishi International University,
$7,080/year.

TM-Sidhi course can become "Governors of the Age of Enlightenment.")
4.  Emotions:  Strengthening of the finest level of feeling to develop
the emotions fully.  /77

$700
9.  Neuro-Muscular Integration:  Vedic exercises [Salutation to the
Sun] to restore mind-body coordination and the integrated functioning

WHAT IS TM-EX?
Transcendental Meditation Ex-Members Support Group (TM-EX) was founded
by former Maharishi International University (MIU) faculty, students,
TM teachers, sidhas, meditators, and caring relatives of members of
the TM movement. TM-EX is a support network to help former and current
members of the TM movement in making the transition to life outside
the TM movement. As former members, we have experienced the transition
and are available to assist you.
WHAT DO WE DO?
We are a referral network and source of information to movement members,
former members, exit counselors, family members and experienced
therapists and professionals.
TM-EX does not represent any particular philosophy, opinion or
lifestyle.
Although numerous religious based groups have challenged TM in the
past, TM-EX is not affiliated with any of these. Its members come
from a wide variety of religious and philosophical backgrounds. What
we do have in common, is our desire to assist those leaving the movement;
to make the public aware of the fraud within the movement; and
the physical and psychological harm, that has resulted for many, from
the practices of the TM Program.
We welcome your input: comments, articles, letters, help with printing
and postage.

Sorry to those of you who have already seen this, but that was quite a
while ago and there are a lot of readers who didn't start following this
newsgroup until after the article became unavailable.  There was a recent
large posting on the subject on brainwashing and cults; this is along the
same lines.  Here it is:
The following is an excerpt from "Combatting Cult Mind Control", by
Steven Hassan, pp. 87-88, published by Park Street Press in Rochester Vermont
in 1988 and 1990:
		PATRICK RYAN AND TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION
	Patrick Ryan, now a successful entrepreneur, was involved in
Transcendental Meditation for ten years.  He is a graduate of Maharishi
International University (MIU) in Fairfield, Iowa, an accredited institution.
Most people think of TM as a harmless way to relax through meditation.  But
for those who plunge deeply into the TM organization, it takes on cult
qualities.
	Pat has since founded a support group called TM-Ex for former members,
and talks openly about the movement's darker side.  "It has all of the
characteristics of a destructive cult," he says.  "A lot of my friends and I
have been greatly damaged by our involvement with it."
	Like most destructive cults, TM uses a good deal of deception (1). Its
public spokespeople say that "TM is not a philosophy, a religion, or a
lifestyle."  Yet, Pat points out, "People become vegetarian, celibate, recite
mantras composed of the names of Hindu gods, and worship Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
as the 'enlightened master of the universe.'"
	In its advertising, TM emphasizes the practical benefits of
meditation - particularly the reduction of stress.  TM promoters show videos
of members from all walks of life testifying to its benefits.  TM sales pitches
are full of blood pressure charts, heart-rate graphs, and other clinical
evidence of TM's effectiveness.  Not mentioned is the fact that scientific
tests show similar benefits can be obtained by listening to soothing music,
or by performing basic relaxation exercises available in books costing a
couple of dollars.
	After a TM student pays up to $400 and receives his own personal
mantra to chant, he is told never to reveal it to another.  Why?  Becuase the
same "unique" mantra has been given - on the basis of age - to thousands of
people (2).
	Most people who learn TM never go beyond the prescribed twenty minutes
of meditating twice a day, in the morning and the afternoon.  They can hardly
be called cult members.  But a few continue to visit the TM centers for
"checking," and go on to pay for more and more advanced courses.  Eventually
they may get to the point Pat did.  He paid $3,000 to learn how to levitate
and fly.  In reality, he found himself reciting the more "advanced" mantras
while vigorously hopping up and down with his legs crossed in the lotus
position for two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon
	Not surprisingly, he experienced painful muscle spasms, headaches, and
involuntary twitching.  He went to his instructors for help.  "They told me
that I was unstressing." he said.  "They told me to go back and meditate and
fly harder."
	"It wasn't until Bob Kropinsky won the first lawsuit against TM for
fraud and negligence that I learned about people who have been hurt by
Transcendental Meditation," (3) Patrick continued.  "The top leaders blame the
members for everything and haven't done anything to correct their policies."
As in other destructive cults, there is never a problem with the leader, the
doctrine, or the organization's behavior - it's always the fault of the
members.
	Pat began to question his involvement with TM only after sitting in
on the deprogramming of his sister Michelle from The Way International.  As
Way ex-members told Michelle the criteria that define a mind control
environment, Pat began to hear alarm bells going off in his head.  The same
methods were used in TM.  He realized his problems were a response to practices
that were short-circuiting his nervous system.
	Pat started digging into every source he could find to understand the
history and background of Maharishi and the organization.  He discovered from
former MIU faculty members that some of the much-touted medical experiments
had been conducted without proper scientific procedure (4).  He has now become
very critical of the organization in which he was previously involved, and
active in warning others of its destructive and deceptive practices.

Steven Hassan is widely recognized as America's leading Exit-Counselor.
(Exit-Counseling is a non-coercize alternative to deprogramming.)
A little bit of my personal opinion: meditation can be a profound, wonderful
thing - it's too bad that frauds like Maharishi use the western mystique
for eastern culture to further their own greedy desires for money and power.
I vote "aye" for an "alt.meditation" newsgroup.

<h1>Site/CMS Info</h1>
<p class="important">Since CMSimple_XH 1.7 the template function <strong>&lt;?php echo poweredbylink()?&gt;</strong> is available. The function creates a link to the automatically generated page "Site/CMS Info" and is meant to replace the usual "Powered by CMSimple_XH" link.<br><br>The link text is "Site/CMS Info" which can be changed by &lt;?php echo poweredbylink(<strong>'alternative text'</strong>)?&gt;<br><br>Text at the beginning of the generated "Site/CMS Info" page can be entered via a hidden news box page named "Site/CMS Info".</p>
<h2>Template designers</h2>
<p>All the templates in the templates folder of a site are listed in the generated "Site/CMS Info" page. You can give a free description of your template together with your designer's link in the file "templateinfo.htm" in your template. Only &lt;a&gt; and &lt;br&gt; tags are allowed and the length must not be greater than 400 UTF-8 characters.</p>
<h2>Plugins</h2>
<p>Except standard plugins all plugins of a site that come with version.nfo file will be listed with a link on the "Site/CMS Info" page.</p>
<h2>Hilfe/ Anleitungen/ Links</h2>
<p>Da CMSimple_XH ein OpenSource-Projekt ist – an dem nur begeisterte Entwickler ohne Bezahlung in ihrer Freizeit arbeiten – gibt es auch keine zentrale Stelle an der alle Informationen an einem Punkt zusammengefasst sind. Es gibt auch keinen Chef, keinen Vorstand oder Ähnliches. Hier eine Zusammenstellung von Links, die bei Fragen zum CMS wichtig sein könnten:</p>
