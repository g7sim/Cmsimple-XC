# cmsimple-XH-CL-1.7.2 - beta 1

* This is a  modified  Fork of Cmsimple XH 1.7.2 with clean urls and a http - security filter.

* It has the same GPL3  license (Licenses of plugins are to be observed)

* It needs at least php 5.4+ (not php 5.3 !)  and is tested with php 7.4

* It should not be used in windows (Xampp etc.) -  and is not compatible with FHS_Adminmenu - maybe in a future version , but most of the 1.7x - plugins function.

* Is offers both tinymce4 and a version of ckeditor 4.73, which allows simple adding of a plugin by extraction into the plugins_external - directory (with dependencies!).

* You may not use ( ] ) [ < = or ? in links !

* This version has an integrated full-backup from the Cmsimple_XH - forum ( start with : ...de/?backup ). The zip  appears after a while under userfiles (filebrowser) and is ready for download.

* The final version will have a different admin-ui and other templates inklusive 
        Bootstrap( https://github.com/g7sim/Bootstrap3-XH  and https://github.com/g7sim/Bootstrap4-XH ) as You can find them in this git.

* If You find bugs, please make an issue (or post in the forum). You may also make a fork and a push with Your solution.
